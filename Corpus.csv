People are not only searching for new solutions to existing problems. They areso searching for new meanings because their life keeps changing and because they are delighted by the discovery of new directions.
The outcome of design must be meaningful to others. The product is used to communicate this meaning.
"Product meanings could be divided into functional and symbolic product meanings, whereas other researchers distinguish between functional, aesthetic and symbolic design.though researchers different categorizations and definitions, there is consensus that the value of products is not only based on pure functionality and utility, butso on intangible values. These intangible values concern for example emotional and socio-cultural needs, symbolism, experiences and psychological satisfaction."
"In order to differentiate between different types of innovation, Norman and Verganti define an incremental innovation as “improvements within a given frame of solutions” and a radical innovation as “a change of frame.”"
"Apart from the identification of the enablers and barriers, the case study (Swedish furniture company) provides insights on how they are connected. Nearlyl enablers and barriers are connected to other issues in the product-development process. Some of these links demonstrate the trade-offs FurnitureCO encounters in the product-development process. For example, the color and material matrix enables the company to manage the quality of the furniture in the product-development process, but at the same time it forms a barrier
towards establishing collaborations with the right designers."
"The identification of enablers and barriers to design driven innovation, and the connections and interactions between them, is of relevance to better understand its influence on the product meaning, as this will affect value creation."
"limitations in material choice and lack of flexibility at the suppliers influence the overall communication of the new product meaning. Ambiguous product meanings interfere with clearly addressing the tangible and intangible needs of consumers. Therefore, it hinders consumers from interpreting and understanding the added value of the products,
which prevents companies from capturing this added value. This study demonstrates the need to recognize the different enablers and barriers that influence the innovation of product meanings throughoutl phases of the product-development process, to strengthen value creation for both consumer and company."
"Social learning can operate through two distinct (and sometimes opposing) channels: on one hand, it can help consumers sort products according to quality, so to yield them objectively better products; on the other hand, it can match consumers with products they have a strong taste for, so to yield them subjectively better matches."
"In internet culture, lurkers are a special group of website users who regularly login to online communities but seldom post.four types of lurking reasons are identified: environmental influence, personal preference, individual-group relationship and security consideration."
"The nature of an online community affects the user’s impression of the community and therefore influences the user’s willingness to spend time or to contribute to the community. The five motivational factors related to the nature of the community are group identity, usability, pro-sharing norm, reciprocity and reputation."
"Online communities are a place where people can voluntarily visit and contribute. Recruiting new members is critical to sustaining an online community, and communities must be designed with that goal in mind. While the importance of recruiting new members is often discussed, most studies focused on new members’ socialization and retention stages, in which they are entangled with existing members, rather than their first experience in an online community. Understanding their first experience of the online community is important because their initial decision to revisit to or join in the community highly rests on their initial mental models formed during their first experience."
"Potential new members leveragedl socio-technical components in the online community and their previous perceptions on the community to build mental models of the online community. Since potential new members are not involved with any members in the community yet, a way of navigating the online community looks similar a way of navigating a general website rather than a typical online community where people interact with each other to achieve mutual or individual goals."
Moderators sometimes became moderators because theywereready friends or family with the streamer. Some referred to this as a “token mod” implying that the person did not become a moderator because of merits but because of their personal connections.
"If not appointed because of an existing relationship, moderators earned their status by being a positive influence in the channel and/or a frequent viewer, which brought them to the streamer’s attention and subsequent appointment as a moderator. This appeared to be the most common path to becoming a moderator and considered equivalent to a recognition and promotion of sorts. “You don’t become a moderator without first being a member of the community."
"Attracting new members raises the challenges of (i) recruiting new members, (ii) selecting the right members, (iii) retaining newcomers until they have robust ties to the community, (iv) teaching newcomers about expected behavior, and (v) protecting the community from potentially damaging behavior of newcomers"
"When potential volunteers are recruited through appeals that match their motivations, the appeals are more persuasive and lead to stronger intentions for volunteers."
"Starting a community requires (i) carving out a new niche, (ii) defending the niche in an ecosystem of competing communities, and (iii) getting to critical mass."
"While digitalization and internationalization are connected with business model scalability , many SMEs are unable to internationalize digitally because they were not designed to scale that way in the early stages of their existence. This may be partly due to the fact that literature on internationalization capabilities has focused on large multinationals, rather than on SMEs."
"Software systems such as CRM and ERP enable better connectivity with customers and suppliers, and enable tracking and management of both customer relationships and business processes. The ability to integrate those systems reflect a firm’s digitalization excellence, which is a key issue for rapidly internationalizing companies."
"Further, it is suggested that a SME’s “digital networking capability” becomes of ultimate importance for its growth; in other words, SMEs need to co-create value with various digitally connected partners."
"Although the of digital platforms and third-party services ease international entry barriers by helping SMEs overcome resource constraints, there isso need for elementary internal staff recruitments (Jin & Hurd, 2018). Indeed, Rachinger. (2019) found that employee’s  competences are among the most significant future  challenges for SMEs considering digitalized business model innovation."
"This study specifies that internationalization of online SMEs is associated with being able to create new partnerships and foster interorganizational system and service integration, particularly with large international online marketplaces and platforms. Further, the of critical information systems such as CRM and ERP software for managing customer relationships and business processes in the digital and international environment is essential."
"However, in line with Bailetti and Craigen (2020) who argue that cybersecurity is not only about protection butso about innovation, the present study argues that cybersecurity is both a necessity and an enabler of scaling through digital internationalization."
"Regarding implications for practice, our results suggest that SMEs seeking growth through digital internationalization need to develop a set of capabilities, specifically in regard to partnering, customer relationship, and business process management, as well as invest in ICT resources and cyber resilience."
New ventures that can successfully adopt digital technologies and develop the necessary capabilities to those resourcesong the value chain are able to generate a variety of benefits to overcome the liabilities of newness and smallness.
"Organizations that can, for example, digitalize information-intensive process- es are able to replace manual steps, which helps streamline actions. Thus, an integrated digitalization enables new ventures to track processes in real time so that workflows become more transparent, whichlows for not only faster decision making butso the identification of processes with improvement potential, which might result in cost savings."
"One of the benefits of digitalisation is that, It further helps organizations identify risk factors. The continuous access to real-time data provides managers with the opportunity to react before problems occur, resulting in potential cost savings. Thus, we believe that the more partsong the value chain are digitalized, the higher are the resource savings."
"In addition, with digitalization comes the “ability to turn existing products or services into digital variants, and, thus, offer advantages over tangible products”. This way, new products can be introduced to the market more easily. Furthermore, a high degree of digitalization enables firms to get digital customer feedback through digital platforms. This way, new ventures can integrate customers’ opinions as they develop digital innovations."
"Our results further show that a high degree of digitalization results in greater market flexibility, such that new ventures integrating digital technologies are able to react quickly to changing market conditions."
"Managers pursuing transnational entrepreneurship should seriously consider establishing operations in a second country,which will provide access to people and assets that will increase the new company’s capacity to create and capture value"
"The role of cross border resouces emerges clearly from this empirical analysis: they can offer competitive advantages since they can ensure access to external resources such as capital, labour and wealthier markets."
"Customer experience is definitely the key to strengthening the cross-border sales. Some of your customers will be promoters, satisfied with your company and happy to put in a good word for you is likely to help you grow your business."
"Enterprises engaged in cross-border not only need to deal with cross-border logistics, exchange rate, and
 other uncertain factors butso need to get through many links, thus pushing up the economic cost and time cost"
"Good infrastructure, open economies and a good industry environment, bringing opportunities for cross-border e-commerce investors"
We propose that innovation ecosystems that develop a sustainable business model engage in a process of valuing value in which they search for a result that satisfiesl actors
"The home country’s business environment is negatively associated with firms’ decisions to invest abroad, and such a negative relationship becomes more severe when firms are state-owned or are lacking an export network."
"The different parts of cross-border regions often show very dissimilar economic histories, technological trajectories, institutional set-ups as well as different social
 dynamics, theyso form barriers obstructing successful integration"
"Differences create the foundation for cross-border growth by offering potentials for new combinations and unexploited synergies, especially when it comes to generate, transmit and share innovation-relevant knowledge"
"Logistics, which consists of warehousing, sorting, packaging, and distribution, play a significant role in cross-border e-commerce transactions since it links sellers and buyers, and supply and demand"
Cross border companies should set goal to be smart businesses which represent the dominant business logic of the future in ecosystem.
"As more and more consumers start shifting their purchases online, there will be a continuous demand for growing innovation in digital experiences. When it comes to expanding internationally with the added complexities associated with different cultures, spending habits, and buyer expectations."
"To start cross-border e-commerce business well, we must first carry out a rational market position, the goal is to occupy the terminal markets, then to the global market and integration of the value chain."
"Weso should build the value chain, carding and supplement. Furthermore, synthesized service platform of cross-border e-commerce should be built to train young backbone of the business, and they should master the skills of cross-border e-commerce."
"The most important building blocks for a cohesive business model should include value creation, value delivery, and value
appropriation."
"A business model shouldways describe how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value."
"A company and its stakeholders can be describedong five dimensions of a company’s business model as, social, financial, customers, business partners and employees."
"Iterating value proposition with an extended range of stakeholders creates larger acceptance, commitment and support for a sustainable business model innovation."
The two primary functions of a business model are value creation for the stakeholders and value capture for the owners.
"When digitalizing a company, it is important to understand the exact customer needs and understand that the heaviest cost associated come from product development and infrastructure development. "
"During business mergers and acqusitions, attention should be paid to, cultural fit, human resource management, management style similarity, politics, cultural tolerance, and social climate."
"A systematic business model should be comprised of Origins of innovations, innovation process, organizational implementation, organizational anchoring and degree of innovativeness."
"Systematic business models related to Internet of Things (IoT) are categorized as add-on, sharing, usage-based, and solution-oriented business models."
"Main challenges when developing Circular Business Models (CBM) are sustainability, supply chain, Company, ICT and Lean-based ones."
"It should be noted that the word VALUE has two separate definitions, expressing both the utility of a particular object and the power to purchase other products that the possession of that object confers. The first is referred to as 'value in use,' while the second is referred to as 'value in exchange.' The items that have the most value in often have little or no value in exchange; on the other hand, the things that have the most worth in exchange often have little or no value in use."
"Capitalism is based on the generation of value. Customers can develop customer value by doing it themselves (insourcing), which is popular in B2B markets. While this is incredibly effective, internal turf difficulties, transfer pricing issues, and distributing the surplus generated by value creation among multiple internal business units may make it inefficient. When a client outsources value creation operations to independent contractors and suppliers, value in exchange is created. The supplier business benefits from the discipline of competitive pricing in unfettered marketplaces since it drives cost efficiency. Companies that are unable to create value are doomed to fail as a result of constructive destruction. While market efficiency may exist, it mayso result in market failures or partial failures in terms of ignoring and serving particular portions of society due to affordability and accessibility concerns."
"Organizations feel obligated to tell us ""what"" they do without first explaining ""why."" Understanding the need (the why) before focusing on the outcome is an important part of the design process (the what). If successful, an organization's 'why' can inspire long-term buy-in from employees and customers by resonating on a deeper, emotional level. The 'Golden Circle' concept, developed by Simon Sinek, was used to examine 100 organisations' value propositions across sixteen industries in order to better understand how they are currently conveying their what, how, and why. When compared to the how and what outcomes, only 24% of organisations explicitly stated their ""why."" This article uses an iterative design method to help firms better understand their value,lowing them to establish their ""why"" from the inside out. This article illustrates why analysing an organization's value proposition should be at the centre of strategy decisions and communication."
"Over 66 percent of the world's population (4.92 billion) uses mobile phones, and more than half of them social media as a result of the digital technology revolution and tremendous expansion of smart phone usage. Mobile social networking has evolved into a critical communication tool, a new trend, a necessity, and a way of life. With information transparency, consumer value shifts quickly, and rapid adaption of similar services in the market place makes it critical for suppliers to keep up with these shifts, which have a direct impact on customer happiness and loyalty. The study considers WeChat (1 billion active users) as the company under study and compares it to WhatsApp (1.5 billion active users) as the main competitor in the industry to establish a value proposition in the real world. Customers' perceptions of value for mobile social networking services are identified, followed by a critical review of the existing value proposition of WeChat with Whatsapp to identify gaps, and lastly, a new value proposition for WeChat is proposed."
"Future research could a marketing analytics method to collect data over time on how web designers treat high-level navigation. According to a convenience sample of financial planning organisations, the About Us page is typically reserved for biographies and mission statements, and these subpages do not stimulate customers to locate a value proposition. Nonetheless, the About Us page indicates legitimacy, which is consistent with institutional theory."
"A organised process for deconstructing value propositions is built using the business system framework. This paradigm is expanded to understand the value-in-use that arises from many contacts, to encompass learning processes, and to realise its interactive and recursive nature."
"The customer value proposition (CVP) is an important tool for expressing how a business intends to give value to its customers. Despite the fact that managers and academics are increasingly using CVP nomenclature, the notion remains poorly understood and implemented; despite the wide scope of study on the value concept, relatively little research on this topic has been published. In response, this article provides a comprehensive review of the fragmented CVP literature, highlighting the lack of a strong theoretical foundation; distinguishes CVPs from related concepts; proposes a conceptual model of the CVP that includes antecedents, consequences, and moderators, as well as several research propositions; illustrates the application of the CVP concept to four different companies; and advances a compelling research agenda."
"It's common for organisations to overlook the strategic of vice presidents, as many examples show, including the ones I've tried to highlight with Boeing and IBM above. They must be delivered in a credible and vivid manner, a problem that marketing frequently takes on with zeal. But, just as important, and perhaps more so, a company's vice president must be taken seriously enough to assure that he or she is actually giving it."
"The notion of value proposition was split into five components by finding and methodically analysing Amazon.com innovations: performance, simplicity of use, reliability, flexibility, and affectivity (PERFA). An attempt to link value proposition and innovation in a novel way. It gives scholars and practitioners a better grasp of how innovation affects the structure of a value offer."
"A company's ""portfolio of value propositions"" to its various external stakeholders, such as consumers, investors, and resource owners, is one of its most important resources. We fill a vacuum in the value proposition literature in this paper by highlighting qualities that distinguish new company value propositions from existing resources, as well as factors that make them useful. A value proposition is defined as something that facilitates and improves commercial transactions between a new business and its external stakeholders. According to the article, two elements distinguish new company value propositions: (1) business transactions with one or more external stakeholders, and (2) investments to establish and improve a new firm's value propositions that enable business transactions."
"Business planning helps our organisation connect around the marketing strategy by examining the environment in which you function, identifying challenges and vulnerabilities, and demonstrating the firm's sustainability."
"Organizational characteristics, policy measures, institutional frameworks and governance are considered emergent topics of research. In contrast, theory building has not attracted much, which suggests that the theoretical body of businesses is still incipient, hindering the establishment of its boundaries and of a suitable research agenda."
"It is important to invest in building solid, theoretical frameworks to analyse the issue. This,ong with empirical research encompassing low-income countries, would enrich the basis for proposing and implementing."
"The literature has typically indicated that entrepreneurs who are motivated by opportunity have superior economic success. However, some argue that entrepreneurship motivated by necessity is the best. In both circumstances, it is critical to understand the entrepreneurs' motives as well as other elements that may influence their decision."
"According to the research, there is a favourable relationship between entrepreneurship and economic growth, particularly in developed nations. Economic growth in rural regions lags behind that in metropolitan areas, and encouraging entrepreneurship might be a realistic method for regional development."
"Social businesses'  operations are seen as effective; nonetheless, social enterprises must build long-term cross-order collaboration and boost regional social and economic growth. The role of social entrepreneurship as a microeconomic method that involves communities and enterprises in the economic and social development of border regions whileso contributing to social cohesion.

"Social entrepreneurship and cross-border institutional collaboration may complement each other, resulting in a more sustainable kind of cooperation. Cross-border collaboration can be an appealing chance to penetrate new markets, thus promoting social cohesion. "
"Interviewees were asked how they would enter a cross-border market and overcome barriers such as transaction fees, a lack of confidence, or language barriers. Interviewees proposed a variety of options, including social franchising, reproducing a successful social model, and local community ownership."
"Given the collaborative and inventive nature of business model innovation, software-based business model development tools (BMDTs) are said to possess great potential to support their users in innovating business models"
"Today, one of the crucial types of business model innovation is the shift from selling products to selling outcome-based services. When selling outcome-based services, a provider assumes responsibility for the performance outcomes of the products and services (e.g., engine functioning) and accepts a penalty for any shortcomings."
"Business model innovation (BMI) refers to the look for new business logic and new ways to make and capture value for stakeholders. It focuses totally on finding new ways to come up with revenues and define value propositions for customers, suppliers and partners. Due to the ever-increasing pace of technological developments and access to new technologies,liances became a critical competitive advantage in many industries. While checking out BMI opportunities, incumbents are increasingly venturing into new business segments. Against the background of an absence of experience and/or resources, firms searched for partners to get access to necessary resources. We call such anliance a business model innovationliance (BMIA)."
Using organizational learning as a framework to classify the various patterns of business model innovation within the international context provides a promising angle.
"Most value creation was achieved by the value-added manufacturing of industrial and agricultural raw materials. Internal customers were familiar throughout the worth chain, from procurement of raw materials to delivering finished products to external customers. The customer value proposition was conspicuously absent because there was no formal or conscious mindset that conglomerate's subsidiaries werel customers of each other. Today, this can be mentioned as internal marketing."
"Companies are transforming themselves digitally to re-think what their clients like and make operating models which will fully benefit what's newly possible and differentiate themselves from their competition. Innovation stays critical to improving society, business growth, and maintaining a competitive benefit inside markets during this landscape. On top of this, the innovation process continues to be an iterative, uncertain, interactive, path-dependent, context-specific and multi-tasking undertaking. It, therefore, remains the case that a critical subject matter in business is to become conscious of the right solutions for implementing a process of innovation, from the preliminary phase of creativity to promote diffusion"
"The effectiveness of business model innovation depends on three process phases. What we develop in collaboration with our customers: value proposition definition, value provision design, and value-in-use delivery.so, success is determined by the coordination of specific value creation and value acquisition. Activities in each phase: identifying value creation opportunities—agreeing on value distribution in value proposition definition, designing the value offering—deciding on the profit formula in the value provision design, and refining value creation processes—regulating incentive structures in the value-in-use delivery. Identifying value creation opportunities—agreeing on value distribution in value proposition definition, designing the value offering—deciding on the profit formula in the value provision design, refining value creation processes—regulating incentive structures in the value-in-use delivery.
"
"Most current research agrees that the two main functions of a business model are to create value for the company's stakeholders and capture value for the company's owners. However, what these terms mean, how to measure them, and most importantly, how the management can affect them remain contentious."
"In recent years, the worth creation for consumers, companies and networks has been facilitated by various technologies (e.g. mobile applications, cloud computing, artificial intelligence) combined with business models like an SE. An SE refers to "" a socio-economic system that enables the intermediate exchange of goods and services between individuals and organizations to increase the efficiency of society and optimize underutilized resources.""

The ability to track shipments and ensure chain-of-custody is made possible by blockchain technology. It can aid in the prevention of cargo theft as well as the identification of the cause of a major problem.
"Cross-border returns are influenced by geographical distance, cultural differences, and institutional variations, but they do not entirely explain cross-border underperformance. Companies profit from cross-border investing by diversifying their portfolios and overcoming domestic investment shortages in saturated markets."
"Companies can actively combat a negative country image by expanding their home bases, purchasing in developing nations, and acquiring through abroad subsidiaries."
"The impediments that put indigenous people behind non-indigenous people in the farming sector include a lack of access to credit, a lack of economic valuation, and a lack of representation."
"Under pressure to increase food production Agriculture in Canada has issues like as cost containment, soil convergence, labour shortages, and climate change."
The most significant benefit of cross-border trading is the global exposure of the goods that merchants deal with.
"Regulations, territorial research, third-party platform, feedback, and communication with other merchants are five points to consider before engaging in cross-border trade."
"Defining the division's position in agri-food commerce, identifying stakeholder challenges, and identifying trends are some ways to enhance the situation for agri-food exports."
"The ultimate purpose of an ecosystem is to create a joint value proposition, and to do so it needs to be broken down into independent modules. These modules must be non-generic, and must be mutuallyigned towards the joint value proposition."
"The term ""ecosystem"" was first introduced into the field of business strategy by the sociologist Amos Hawley, and it encompasses a set of actors that contribute to the focal offer's user value proposition."
Ecosystems are groups of firms that coordinate their resources in a specific way to create value. This is done through standards or base requirements thatlow firms to make their own decisions while still creating a complex interdependent product or service.
"Ecosystems are created by powerful firms to create or extract value. For instance, in the Google/Android ecosystem, Samsung and Motorola are creating sub-ecosystems to create or extract value."
"The total value perceived by the end-customer is an outcome of a complex set of integrated value activities and companies, but the end-customer evaluates them as one entity or offering."
The value activities of a strategic network are the outcomes of the resources and capabilities deployment of the actors. The value activities are linked with the resource-based view of strategicliances.
"Value activitiesso differ in respect to their underlying relevanceand ability to enable revenues or profitability to their holders.According toParolini (1999: 110), the activities enabling profitability(1) are critical for the entire value creation system and thefinalproduct/service, (2) have some unique elements, (3) are“visible”tothe end consumers, (4) require skills and resources that cannot beeasily imitated, (5) correspond to the bottlenecks of the VCS, and (6)influence the behavior of the entire value creating system."
"A well-articulated value chain strategy (VCS) helps managers identify profitable and otherwise strategically attractive activities that match the hub company's existing resource and capability base. The nature of the value activity a potential partner controls in the overall business concept determines the partner's role (strategic, non-strategic). Understanding customer value and the related value-creating system facilitates the identification of the core activities that award the power position in the network and a strong share of the earnings."
"New companies committed to scale need to operate across borders, innovate relentlessly, profitably adopt emerging technologies, and execute capital investment programs that enable them to meet aggressive growth objectives. The successful operations of such companies depend on their constructive engagement with multiple external stakeholder groups. Each stakeholder group has unique needs and objectives. The multiplicity of critically relevant external stakeholders necessitates the formulation of multiple valuable propositions that target very different groups with dissimilar roles, needs, and priorities."
"Managing a “portfolio of diverse value propositions” requires the development of company capabilities that can configure internal and external resources in a way to deliver promises made to the different external stakeholders, as well as achieve the objectives of the company’s master scaling plan. New companies that wish to scale rapidly require value proposition development capabilities that go beyond the ones required by companies that have small or moderate growth objectives. Diverse value propositions,l having a logic to scale early and rapidly since inception, must be developed. Each value proposition must then beigned with the value propositions ofl other key stakeholders, as well as with the new company’s pathway to scale."
"The elemental version of our value proposition perspective applies to multiple stakeholders and incorporates what we call “reciprocal dialogues”. It highlights the need for a new company to develop two types of value propositions (1) value propositions to anchor business transactions (set prices for good and services) or investment (set company valuation), and (2) value propositions to attract external partners to make commitments to create and improve theready existing value propositions that enable business transactions (set terms for information and technology exchanges during product feature co-creation)."
"In service-driven economies characterized by rapid changes due to digitalization, globalization, and an increasing focus on value creation through customer experiences, service innovation is critical to survive and necessary for success. Innovation involves collaboration between actors that leverages existing and new resources in smart ways to create social and business value that drives growth, creates jobs, and ensures a dynamic, healthy economy. Tesla clearly illustrates the need for collaboration with multiple actors and infrastructure support to leverage existing and new resources. The innovation is in how the ecosystem of batteries, cars and, not least, a network of stations to charge the batteries, to note some of the resources necessary to enable innovation to scale up. When more actors become engaged and can extract value, the ecosystem scales up"
"For a service ecosystem to profitably scale up and become sustainable, it must manage the integration of the norms, rules, and habits that customers and other engaged actors appreciate and with which they want to be associated. Both Eataly and KidZania have developed and manage innovations that resonate with the values among customers and other actors in many markets and thus add value for the society and the local community."
"Company culture, prior agile and lean experience, management support, and value unification were found to be key success factors during the action research process. Resistance to change, an overly aggressive roll-out time frame, quality assurance concerns, and integration into preexisting nonagile business processes were found to be the critical challenges in the scaling process"
"The ecosystem model of scaling social impact has its practical implications. It can help social impact practitioners to improve their strategies with a better understanding of the elements of the ecosystem they need to be aware, foster, or build. It can help policymakers consider which kind of policies creates favorable conditions for a larger scale of social change. It can promote philanthropy leaders and impact investors pay more attention to the role of institutional infrastructure in facilitating and amplifying the scaling of social impact, rather than merely focusing on organizational growth."
"The higher the number of potential foreign buyers, the higher the equilibrium acquisition price, and the higher the number of young companies selling out. This implies fewer companies scaling up, which in the long runso means that the number of domestic anchor companies remains lower."
"One distinguishing feature concerns the rapidness of growth, with the highest pace of growth typically evident in the scaling stage of the organizational life cycle (Coad, 2018). In fact, many scaling firms exhibit hyper growth rates exceeding 40% annually (World Economic Forum, 2016), which is substantially above the 20% rate that normally denotes high growth (OECD, 2007). Another distinct feature of scaling strategies is that, compared to high growth in mature firms, which typically deal with path dependencies and rigidities while attempting to grow (Sirmon., 2011), scaling firms need to deal with a sense of turmoil, chaos, and great inefficiencies while growing. This is because the internal organization of scaling firms is neither well developed nor cost-optimized (DeSantola and Gulati, 2017; Sullivan, 2016), and there are limits for an organization to learn from prior experience if resource development is compressed in time (Dierickx and Cool, 1989)."
"Scaling strategies areso distinct because of their focus on capacity boosting to exploit the viable business model at scale (Autio, 2016; Reuber., 2021; Sullivan, 2016; Zhao., 2020), where substantial economies of scale can be accrued, especially when the has a digital business model (Coviello, 2020; Tippmann., 2018). Capacity boosting requires an increasing commitment to bundling resources into formalized activities. This contrasts with the resource flexibility required for experimentation during the start-up phase (Clarysse., 2011; Sirmon., 2011)."
"When entrepreneurs begin the process of organizing their new ventures, they encounter contexts in which other people—vendors, investors, employees, customers, regulators, and so forth—already have their own expectations concerning entrepreneurship and the practices, processes, and products they will be offered ([ 5]). Such expectations will constrain, to some extent, entrepreneurial creativity and innovation. Of course, those expectations mightso educate entrepreneurs by showing them what they are supposed to do, depending on the context. Many of these expectations come from institutions, which are collections of stable rules and roles with a corresponding set of meanings that constrain actions ([20]), leading humans to select activities based on their appropriateness, rather than on more technical but potentially less appropriate criteria ([14])."
"In gen-eral, we know that a builds a business model with the objective of exploiting a market opportunity, thus cre-ating value for the parties involved. The business model itself can be understood as an interdependent system of resource and activities, which are centered on the itself. The role of the is central because the activi-ties necessary for the creation of value – in the economic and technological sense – are connected and there-fore must be coordinated. This brings us to the other side of the coin. A business model canso be defined by the content, structure and governance of the transactions designed to create value by exploiting business op-"
"By adopting digitalization, a company will be able to generate various benefits like reducing the number of resources for day-to-day operations.so, it helps in new value creation for existing customers and they may pay more for the advanced services. Based on the project specifications, companies have their desired value creation and resources reductions. It is required to launch a digitalization project by understanding the full value to attain the maximum contribution to the success of an organization."
"Digitalization is having a significant impact on firms by enabling the transformation in their operation and value propositions. It isso, enhances customer interaction. It helps in removing the international barrier and helps SMEs in international market engagements. It is having a direct impact on competencies for the firms to compete in foreign markets. It becomes easy for the firms to locate investors, required talents, and change agents by creating the network and source of data. Digitalization redesigns the business model to enable new opportunitiesong with new value creations and developing customer relationships. It facilitates a few companies via adding different services as a complement in product offers to add the support in a broader way."
"Technology is having a critical factor for business models in the tourism industry and explains the power of digitalization (denotes the application of computer-based technology)in the tourism sector. Technology has replaced the current way of business operations. Digitalization has introduced advancements related to tourist behavior transitioning from sitting and searching to roaming. It has provided the sources of information, content from various users, and connection establishment among various platforms. In tourism, online booking systems, e-tourism tickets, and platform-based businesses are the results of digitalization in this sector. In this way, we can see digital solutions for a few firms and or it has created an entirely new business segment for new entrants."
"The introduction of the digitalization of the global economy provides opportunities for internationalization and scaling forl types of firms. More and more digital innovations are reducing the international penetration processes timings from years to a few weeks. Many SMEs are unable to internationalize digitally because they were not designed to scale that way in the early stages of their existence and our current understanding of business model scalability is still under-developed, however, digitalization has created new possibilities for SMEs to scale up and internationalize. The fact about SMEs accomplishes business model scaling through digitalization is yet to know.so, a major gap in our current understanding of scaling lies in how digitalization affects firms international growth and whether the business models of domestic firms differ from those that have internationalized."
"SMEs nowadays are pretty used to the term ""digital transformation"" as a key term to express organizational changes influenced by digital technologies. The digital transformation that induces a radical change in organizations is expressed byl of the scientific articles, while its concrete definition is not been widely accepted till now. The acceleration in digital technological development, together with the increasing globalization of associated economies, is increasing innovation cycles for products and services. It is creating new business models and transforming operational, management, and organizational structures of existing businesses and consumers. Many companies, especially SMEs, struggle to engage in a coherent global digital transformation process, despite the importance of digitalization."
"Digital technologies provide ubiquitous data, unlimited connectivity, and massive processing power and can be a game-changer in terms of Product enabler and Business modal innovation. Usage of Digital Platform to generate the ideas like My Starbucks Idea, Fiat Mio, and their success. In the first 5 years, My Starbucks Idea had generated more than 150,000 ideas and the company had implemented 277 of those ideas. No matter how big or small, Starbucks incentivizes customers to submit ideas and engage with the website. Dell's Listening center and Google's chrome are examples of Sentiment analysis, which collects Dell-related topic posts, Sentiments, wishes, and recommendations towards Chrome products. These contribute to further research and continued development of the corresponding products."
"Digital Communities setup methods like bootstrapping i.e. Usage of own resources to start the community, Recruiting Website i.e. place of interest for early adopters, and Crowd Renting i.e. using the community for an established crowdsourcing business to solve a certain task. Apple Product Launch failure and Service innovation failure in the banking industry are examples of things not going well in Digital innovation. There are several problems like distraction i.e. driving performance, pedestrian activity, work performance, academic performance addiction & impulsive behavior of digital products to Users. Examples like Ethical issues in Mobile applications, Robotics and AI, Facebook’s year review, Adidas’s Boston Marathon email, etc. are examples of problems of digital products."
"Digital technologies have ushered in a new industrial revolution, bringing disruptive changes as well as future progress. Globalization has been defined by the movement of goods and services between nations for decades.though the dynamics of physical flows are currently moderate, globalization is not slowing down. Organizations are transforming in such a way that a fundamental need for change is arising in their structure and operating methods. Complex economic systems are emerging that must be grasped, in a concrete way. In this context, digital technologies and platforms have been developed to reach new markets and to resize the economics of cross-border business, notably by reducing costs, shortening transactions, and enhancing market knowledge through greater interactions."
"Case studies have well-described how digitalization affects business models as per (Neubert, 2017 & 2018). Based on this understanding, digitalization's role in defining an SME's competitive advantages, as well as its interaction with other factors, is vital to their planning and decision-making. In order for SMEs to accelerate their internationalization, it is important to understand the relationships between digitalization, various resources, and the capabilities that give a a competitive advantage. The major goal of this research is to look at how digitalization affects SMEs and to construct a model for the factors that influence SMEs' competitiveness in international marketplaces, with a focus on digitalization, resources, and competencies."
"Much of the current research in this area is explanatory or conceptual rather than empirical, and is based on case studies from several disciplines (for example, strategy, management, innovation, and informatics). An initial search on Google Scholar yields an astonishing number of suggested papers for search terms like ""digitalization,"" which has 58,100 links, ""digital disruption,"" which has 5,570 connections, and ""digital transformation,"" which has 25,500. In addition to the availability of published studies, technology vendors are increasingly focusing a lot of emphasis on digital technology advances. Both research and practice are lacking in a solid foundation of previously published findings to guide and underpin the future studies of new digital technologies."
"Work has become more flexible as a result of digital technologies, and the lines between work and free time have blurred (Grönlund & Öun, 2018). This presents both opportunities and challenges for women in terms of balancing career and family obligations. Flexible employment, in combination with the increased of digital technologies, may have a good impact on women's work-life balance. Because technologies might be viewed as tools or strategies for completing specific tasks, they have no intrinsic worth and must be integrated into social contexts that are frequently dynamic and gender-based. According to Huyer and Sikoska (2003), women must be persuaded that ICTs are beneficial to them. In addition, because today's ICTs aren't gender-neutral, they aren'tways acceptable for women's requirements (Huyer & Sikoska, 2003); at least not without proper adaption."
"The terms ""digitalization"" and ""digitization"" are frequently used interchangeably. Both terms refer to the same object,though they mean different things. Digitization is the translation of analog information into digital forms, whereas digitalization is the arrangement of multiple and various social life areas via digital communication technology. Digitalization technologies consist of artificial intelligence (AI), robots, automation, the Internet of Things, big data, 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, drones, cyber weapons. dDgitalization refers to the of any digitalization technology on any part of the commercialization activities of companies."
"Disruptive technology (DT) can be defined as “A technology that changes the bases of competition by changing the performance metricsong which firms compete.”The concepts of DT tracing the origins of this mainstream theory to the seminal work. The concept of DT itself was introduced in the late 1990s, later modified to disruptive innovation (DI) to more holistically include not only technological disruptions. Since then, DT seems to have been increasingly absorbed into the conceptualization of DI."
"How disruptive innovations have helped man to master his enemies and extend his power and influence. The of the bow and arrow, and gunpowder in later centuries are instances of how the adoption of a disruptive technology and its innovative application had decisively impacted the creation of new empires and kingdoms.Over the course of history, mankind has perfected its industry by not only relying on disruptive technical evolution butso by reinventing it as new resources have created new technical means and made possible disruptive innovations."
"The education sector will be highly impacted by the developments in disruptive Information and Communications Technologies, and corresponding innovative changes in pedagogy. In the near future, traditional college and university education connected with high income generating professional courses like science, engineering, and management studies may well lose its primacy. Many mediocre and economically weaker students may prefer to enroll in cheaper online distance courses leaving only the meritorious and well-off students to pursue the expensive higher education delivered by brick and mortar colleges and universities. Consequently, many brick-and-mortar colleges and universities may not be required and get phased out"
"To manage disruption requires leaders to balance the tension between exploiting a core business that generates reliable, short-term results, and exploring into new areas where results are uncertain, even if the long-term payoff may prove to be attractive. Too often, organizations, faced with potential disruption from competitors, commit resources to generate new ideas for exploration but struggle to convert these ideas into meaningful businesses"
"To deal with discontinuous innovation, firms must master three distinctstages or disciplines, idea generation (ideation), incubation (validation), and growth (scaling). While these three stages canso apply to incremental innovation, being successful at discontinuous innovation requires leaders to be more sophisticated at managing these stages (see Table 1), especially in how they approach scaling. Furthermore, mastering only one or two of these stages is insufficient. Having new ideas that do not meet the market test, having market-tested ideas that can not be scaled, or scaling ideas that are not market validated arel recipes for failure. Success needsl three."
"First, disruptive innovation provides a significant competitive advantage to firms which stems from being a quick mover or a quick follower, while latecomer firms are featured in flexible organisational structure and quick response ability which makes it possible. Second, disruptive innovation is a process which is usually difficult to be captured by incumbents due to lack of economic incentives and/or existing organisational barriers. In contrast, however, latecomer firms will be provided with the entry chances into the fringe market which can obtain survival by avoiding the disadvantages of resource constraints and further to disrupt the mainstream market."
"Disruptive innovation as: An innovation process in which technologies, products or services are initially inferior than those provided by incumbents in the attributes that mainstream consumers value, but these technologies, products or services can attract and satisfy the consumers in low-end or new markets with advantages in performance attributes (such as being cheap, simple, or convenient) that these consumers value but which at the same time are neglected by mainstream markets. Over time, through incremental improvement of technology or process, a disruptive innovation gradually satisfies the needs of mainstream consumers, so as to attain certain market share from or even replace incumbents in mainstream markets."
"Technology disruption takes place when the performance of a new technology dominates the current mainstream technology. In other words, technology disruption occurs when the performance of new technology surpasses the performance of the dominant one. disruption means the market share of a whose products benefit from a new technology exceeds the market share of the largest firms in the mainstream market”."
Overuse of disruptive innovation/disruption as a synonym for any new threat (or substantial ongoing change) and underuse of disruptive innovation as a theoretical concept. Many popular writers invoke disruptive innovation to describe any new technology or startup that aims to shake up an industry andter its competitive patterns; previously successful incumbents facing difficulties or going out of business are routinely said to have been disrupted.
"Low-end disruptions are those that attack the least-profitable and most over-served customers, begin in a low-end market, with inferior performance as regards traditional attributes and by offering a low price and design simplicity. These innovations are designed for customers for whom the incumbent’s offer provides excess functionality at unaffordable prices. Such disruptions are associated with the strategies of opportunities discovery. Incumbents pay less attention to less-discerning customers and typically offer their products to their most profitable, more discerning customers"
"New-market disruptions begin with least-demanding tier and compete against non consumption, are specifically focused on creating consumption and are disruptions that create a new value network. These innovations provide products with a different group of features from the mainstream product for customers who “had not owned or used the prior generation of products or services” or new users. Unlike low-end disruptions, new market disruptions do not necessarily compete on lower price, adding that many disruptive changes are hybrids of low-end and new market disruption (e.g. Canon Photocopier). New market disruption into two types: fringe-market low-end encroachment and detached-market low-end encroachment"
"Disruptive technologies offer a different package of attributes valued by only in emerging markets remote and from, and unimportant to, mainstream."
"According to proponents of the process driven business model, relationships between the components of a model are the subject of dynamic change thus looking at a specific business model at a certain point in time is a reflection of the prevailing circumstances. Demil and Lecocq (2010) highlights three core components of a process driven business model, namely, resources and competencies, organizational structure, and propositions for value delivery. Changes within or between these components may impact the model hence making it a dynamic ‘organism’ with the propensity for change signalled by changes in the inter-relational and intra-relational components of the model. Demil and Lecocq (2010) thus conclude that anticipating and reacting to the ‘consequences of evolution in any given component’ is a capability crucial to build and maintain sustainable performance."
"Baden-Fuller and Morgan (2010) postulated to the effect that business models may be perceived as the outcome of the combination of recipes. In this metaphor, the ingredients of those recipes would be resources, capabilities, products, customers, technologies, markets, regulations, and so on. What constitutes a successful recipe in one instance may differ from what constitutes success in another instance. The capability to know what factors can produce which anticipated outcomes, and an appreciation of why is key to building a successful business model in line with the cognitive school of thought"
"As one of the first to introduce the concept of open business models, Chesbrough (2006, 2007b) proposes that incumbents should open-up their traditionally closed business models because a stronger collaboration with partners helps a to find and seize novel, external opportunities. Conceptually, the open business model extends the concept of openness from the innovation and value creation context tol aspects of a business model. To this end, the author believes that discovery-driven planning could unravel uncertainties which itself can provide a basis for business model innovation."
"According to the Duality school, implementing a unique business model requires explorative activities as BMIs are somehow new in nature and long for new organizational processes, structures, and capabilities. This is in stark contrast to an operating business model of a company, which is most often directed at exploitation. A conundrum emerges which is characterized by whether there is a conflict with the established business and whether there is a similarity with the established business"
Business models should thus be treated as dynamic systems that can and should betered to address challenges and opportunities of the broader environment.
"Weso know that digital technologies are profoundly impacting the ways in which corporations manage production, work and employment relations within global value chains (GVCs)"
The large number of new opportunities driven by digitalization put pressure on SMEs to reconsider their current business models or critically reflect on their current strategy in order to identify new business opportunities.
"Digital transformation is not about optimizing internal processes or incorporating new technologies, but fundamentally changing SMEs’ business models"
"Digitalization leads firms to radical transformations in their systems and processes, as well as in their management methods and workforce."
Building up a high degree of digitalization in new ventures seems to be a promising strategy for new ventures to overcome the liabilities of newness and smallness.
"An ever growing number of aspects of most societies and their economies are inextricably linked to changes brought forward by technological developments that are transforming people’s everyday routines, perceptions of the environment, access to the electricity, food, health, education and many others."
"In contrast, online communities for low-skilled micro-task platforms were more controlled with little opportunity for crowdworkers to interact with each other. This, Gerber argued, was done to curb ‘irresponsible autonomy’ or worker resistance. Moreover, Gerber finds the design of community spaces as forms of indirect control via ‘community engineering’ whereby workers used these spaces individually to cope with their negative work experiences and thereby minimizing contestation and conflict. Therefore, these spaces did not become vehicles for building collective worker power. Rather, they were designed as instruments of selfregulation and self-disciplining, turning workers into self-managers."
"Smart factories, moreover,low managers to electronically track individual workers and how long it takes a worker to finish a process on a particular product. Such digitalized worker management methods areso increasingly being applied in offices, contributing to an uberization of work beyond the offline gig economy"
"Sometimes a startup may believe its new technology is captivating enough on its own that it does not require an explicit customer value proposition. As a result, most often a startup does not have sufficient understanding of how its offering would affect the customer's business. It is therefore often unable to provide a monetary estimate of customer value that prospective customers find convincing."
"A successful innovative offering value proposition convinces the customer that the startup's offering will provide extraordinary value, if the startup can actually realize it. The leveraging assistance value proposition identifies which specific support and resources the startup will receive and what the startup will give in return for that."
"Once we understand the job andl its dimensions, including the full process for how to get it done, we can design the offering. The more important the job is to the customer, the lower the level of customer satisfaction with current options for getting the job done, and the better your solution is than existingternatices at getting the job done, the greater the customer value proposition."
"New companies that wish to scale rapidly require value proposition development capabilities that go beyond the ones required by companies that have small or moderate growth objectives. Diverse value propositions,l having a logic to scale early and rapidly since inception, must be developed. Each value proposition must then beigned with the value propositions ofl other stakeholders, as well as with the new company' pathway to scale."
"As one of the most widely used terms in business, a customer value proposition should be the firm's single most important organizing principle, considering that it is crucial to the value creation process, with significant performance implications. There are three broaden perspectives on the customer value proposition: customer value propositions that are principally supplier-determined, reflecting a value-in-exchange emphasis; customer value propositions that are transitional, with recognition of the customer experience; and customer value proposition that are matually determined, reflecting a value-in-use emphasis."
"Value propositions have been described as the reasons a customoer will value a firm's offering. Recent developments in the sustainable business model innovation space have led to the extension of the value proposition concept to integrate sustainabilitiy if its logic. Sustainable value propositions are the result of generating shared value for a network of stakeholders, while addressing a sustainabliity problem, and developing a product or service that tackles the problem."
"Being faced with increasing competition on a global scale, supplier firms are constantly searching for means to gain and maintain competitive advantage by differentiating themselves and their market offering from competitors. This quest for differentiation has directed managerial attention to both, a broader and a deeper undestanding of how firms create value for their customers."
Identifying patterns in similar data and determining the results inherent in a particular group identificate problems in complex data sets and provide the results for practical use.
"Composing of interacting subsystems areways to some degree interdependent and intercoperate exclusively by using redefined,stable interfaces in order to connect the platform by modules and add functionality to the platform."
"Enabling efficient infrastructure sharing by different network users, opening the ecosystem to new players, and accelerating time to market by reducing service creation and activation times with the logical interface between network and business applications by providing an abstraction of the network towards applications and interfaces let easy service creation, optimization and expose actionable network insights to application and content providers, enterprises, and industry verticals."
"Choosing a process framework for provider–customer outcome-based service relationships whose phases will be value proposition definition, value provision design, and value-in-use delivery , willso create both value creation and value capture  that are reiterated between the provider and customer. Thus each phase will ensure iterative cycles of value creation and value capture activities with the logic of successfulignment and progression to the next phase. "
"Improving and extending the scope of value creation over time, emphasizing on value-creation processes in the implementation phase as successful business model innovation requires significant effort in delivering value in to make the business relationship sustainable for both parties over time. In this phase, ensuringignment by simultaneously refining value creation processes and regulating incentive structures will be important."
"Visualization of the business models by highlighting the importance of partners, customers or other exchange partners and the importance of cooperation in the value creation process willso create value for customers."
"Getting benefit from the design thinking methods of value mapping,value proposition prototyping, and value proposition implementation for development of sustainable BMs willlow for a repeatable process that can be adopted by firms looking to develop new sustainable BMs. "
"Focusing on design for the process of companies let individual projects , internal processes, and entire business models innovate as design’s heritage is often manifested in physical products,lowing, through the set of choices made by designers and engineers, for the development of technological solutions focused on meeting a market need or demand."
"Optimizing and integrating business processes provides synergically interconnected system of business activities with each other in the business process management (BPM) achieve competitive advantage and create, distribute value."
"In dynamic, open and highly collaborative environments, business model innovation (BMI) is aimed at creating innovative value propositions, based on exploration and exploitation of new business opportunities’ forecast, process and product innovation in an holistic approach of BPMI."
"The ongoing dynamic occurring at operational level by system of procedures can be optimized for measuring, mapping and integrating activities and further improvements become necessary on the side of streamlining the process of operations by recurring to the ecosystem resources which require in-depth integration among business units to ensure viability of processes in value capture
operations."
"To qualify for an innovation, the new business model must enlarge the existing economic pie, either by attracting new customers into the market or by encouraging existing customers to consume more and BMI phases should contain the four phases identified are initiation (understanding the ecosystem), ideation (generating new ideas), integration (aligning the business model internally), and implementation (making investments)."
"Disruption through complements arises from a combination of dynamic forces: technological changeters the calculations of cost and benefit of entry over time, organizational learningters the understanding of opportunity, and capability buildingters the complementor’s effectiveness in pursuing new goals."
A given can conceive of itself as core and see the rest of the system as complementary to its value creation.
"Within the ecosystem, competition from one domain affects competition in the other."
"Disruption through complements is distinctive in that the threat arises not from outside entrants or existing rivals but rather from complementors— actors that areready contributing to value creation and therefore have resources, capabilities, relationships, and learning opportunities that differ from those that characterize other potential threats."
"Commoditization comprises a shift in power, influence, and/or value away from a focal and toward an ecosystem partner. Adjacent entry converts a partner into a direct rival. Value inversion gradually transforms a complement into a substitute."
"To improve customer satisfaction, firms should strengthen the perceptions of their customer relationships as well as adopt different strategies: entrants should focus on channels, whereas incumbents should concentrate on value propositions."
Disruptive technology can only be successful if it has a clear strategy for gaining market share.
"As performance meets and eventually surpasses existing needs, competition shifts to other dimensions. Less-integrated offerings and businesses with modular architectures become viable."
"When products are not yet good enough to satisfy customers’ performance requirements, firms rely on internally interdependent integrated product architectures to maximize performance."
The organizational and managerial mechanisms that contribute to disruption are a devotion to an existing customer base and the abandonment of certain market segments.
"When a disruptive innovation emerges in an adjacent market, an incumbent can create an autonomous organizational unit and task it with developing and commercializing the new innovation."
"Different members (or sides) of the ecosystem coalescing around a platform have motivations and interests that may diverge even as they jointly create value. Not surprisingly, some relationships are cooperative and some are competitive. Yet others, however, are co-opetitive."
Incumbents are advised to reduce errors of omission by pursuing innovations that could be disruptive in the future well before others.
"To reduce errors of omission, incumbents must cultivate the capacity to read weak signals about potentially disruptive innovations and explore options before it is too late. To do so, it is critical to ‘set the stage’, by putting in place mechanisms to seek out ideas with potential future value and keep themive for activation at an appropriate time."
"A performative approach enables firms to take actions, learn, and transform as the phenomenon unfolds, thereby potentially limiting the likelihood of errors of omission and commission."
"Disruptive technological change challenges the modalities of regulatory control. Because these technologies often hold great promise for social and economic benefit, their innovative development is to be encouraged. Pre-emptive regulatory controls may stifle innovation or lock in suboptimal variations of the new technology. On the other hand, new technologies often have highly uncertain potential costs."
"Customers’ perception of the innovativeness of business models despite other quality criteria improves customer satisfaction and seems to be a relevant quality signal. Therefore, shaping the customers’ perception and awareness about business model innovation is an important driver of business performance."
"The effect of CPBMI on customer satisfaction is partially mediated through customer value co-creation behavior. This indicates, that there are two avenues from CPBMI to customer satisfaction: namely, (1) to trigger customer cocreation behavior and create satisfaction in return, and (2) to directly impress the customer through CPBMI."
"Business models need to be legitimized at the market in order to be adapted by customers. The existing knowledge regarding the outcomes of business model innovation (Foss and Saebi, 2017) beyond direct performance consequences (Karimi and Walter, 2016). In addition to this widely accepted direct consequence, business model innovation will be recognized by customers and will trigger reactions in terms of co-creation and lead to greater satisfaction."
Perceived value creation innovativeness and value proposition innovativeness positively affect customer satisfaction and customer value co-creation behavior.
"The customer value proposition is a core construct of marketing and has been recognized as the firm's single most important organizing principle. It is defined as “a strategic tool facilitating communication of an organization's ability to share resources and offer a superior value package to targeted customers” . Seen through a strategic lens, customer value propositions have a dual role. First, they communicate a superior value creation potential to targeted customers. Second, they summarize the essence of marketing strategy decisions and signal implementation priorities to the actors in the supplier organization."
"The two key measures of quality of business models are customer value (effectiveness) and business value (efficiency).[2] The objective of every for-profit is to move to and stay in the “Winner state,” characterized by simultaneous provision of outstanding customer and business value. The first step to enhancing the value produced by the business model is asking the right questions, ones that will inform the strategic development agenda of companies’top management teams and boards."
"To be effective, the analysis of customer value has to be fine-grained: A major insight is the need to consider value proposition (what is promised), value targeting (who is the primary recipient) and value delivery (how the promise is fulfilled) separately, which most companies don’t do."
"A superior value proposition has to be matched with correct value targeting. Who is the primary customer being offered the best-in-class value? A business model is intended to servel stakeholders of the firm, including end-users, buyers, sales channel partners, key suppliers and obviously investors. Yet, in most cases it is impossible to maximize the value provided to each stakeholder. Therefore, while providing sufficient value to each critical stakeholder to ensure their buy-in, management must choose a key stakeholder and focusl its efforts on optimizing the value provided to this primary customer."
"Value propositions capture the essence of marketing strategy decisions and signal strategic priorities to the supplier organization and its customers. Against the backdrop of firms' resources and capabilities, value propositions delineate the superior contribution to their goals that targeted customers can expect from engaging with the supplier firm. Value propositions distill fundamental resource deployment and market selection decisions that are the cornerstones of strategic marketing . "
"Value propositions offer strategic guidance that may improve marketing programignment and resource deployment processes within a supplier . When communicated towards targeted customers, value propositions can sharpen the firm's positional advantage, which is the proximate reason for superior performance and reflects “the relative value actually delivered to target markets as a result of the firm's marketing strategy decision implementation efforts, and the cost of accomplishing this to the firm” . "
"A customer value proposition (CVP) is a strategic tool facilitating communication of an organization's ability to share resources and offer a superior value package to targeted customers. In contrast with other definitions and descriptions, this definition (1) highlights CVP's critical role as a communication device, (2) emphasizes the role of resources and resource sharing, and (3) stresses the need for an appropriate ""package"" of value that is differentiated from and superior to competitive offerings."
"There are four CVP perspectives, that indicate if it is effective or not: First, the value package should include both benefits and costs that establish clear differentiation from competitive offerings and are important to targeted customers. Second, a necessary consideration involves how value gets distributed across the customer relationship, before, during, and after the usage experience, including when the greatest value might be created. Third, nature of the resource sharing is pertinent, especially in instances in which deeper reciprocal engagement might result in meaningfully cocreated CVPs. Fourth, firms must determine which CVP design characteristics to emphasize when developing value propositions."
"To sustain a superior customer value proposition, a supplier must be obsessed with a customer’s problem (to solve), rather than with the supplier’s available solution (to sell). This “problem focus”lows managers to see numerous opportunities to improve the offered benefits, keeping the value proposition relevant over time."
"Business model innovation matters to managers, entrepreneurs and academic researchers for several reasons. First, it represents an often underutilized source of future value. Second, competitors might find it more difficult to imitate or replicate an entire novel activity system than a single novel product or process. Third, because business model innovation can be such a potentially powerful competitive tool, managers must be attuned to the possibility of competitors’ efforts in this area."
"An innovative business model can either create a new market orlow a company to create and exploits new opportunities in existing markets. Dell, for example, implemented a customer-driven, built-to-order business model that replaced the traditional built-to-stock model of selling computers throw retail stores."
"Two phases are critical for firms’ BMI. The first is the design phase, in which firms discover, create, and select a new business model based on their (and their stakeholders’) goals, templates from their current or other industries, stakeholders they could or plan to involve in the businesses, and their environmental constraints. The second is the operation phase, in which firms exploit and adapt their innovative business models to create and capture value together with their external stakeholders."
Collaborations not only shape how innovative business models are designed butso affect the operation of innovative business models. By this we mean the processes through  which a focal exploits an innovative business model design and adapts the business model further to environmental changes.
"We formally define the business model as the system of independent activities that are performed by a focal and by its partners and it mechanisms that link these activities to each other.An activity in a focal firms' business model can be viewed as the engagement of human, physical, and/or capital resources of any party to the business model (the focal firm, end customers, vendors, etc. to serve a specific purpose toward the fulfillment of the overall objective.An activity system is a set of interdependent and interconnected activities that are centered on a focal firm; it encompasses activities that are conducted either by the focal or by partners, customers, or vendors."
"To fully address a market opportunity, a firm's business model (a.k.a activity system) many transcend the focal and span across the and its industry boundaries, but it remains centered on a focal firm, enabling the focal not only to create value with its partners through the activities they perform, butso to appropriate a share of the value created. The firm's revenue model plays an important role in value appropriation."
"One of the most important skills needed to become a good business model designer is the ability to think holistically about your firm's current or future business model. This ability to ""see the big picture"" willlow you to conceptualize and innovate at a system level. Adopting a design-oriented business mother mindsets, you will be equipped to design a that is ready to meet expected future trends (for example, in technology)."
"Content, structure and governance can be highly interdependent, and they need to be in line with the value creation and capture goals of the company, such as its revenue model, which could be referred to as  the raison d’être, or the WHY of the business model."
" As a result, choices about business model design often go unchallenged for a long time – sometimes for too long a time. In disruptive  and quickly changing environments, seeing the whole picture and acting upon it early can be a matter of corporate survival."
"A business model framework is a basic structure that spells out the building blocks (components) for acquiring and using resources to generate, deliver and monetize customer benefits. Importantly, it is a shared language that can be used to zoom in on strategically meaningful activities and their consequences for value creation and capture. Thus, the framework can be used to develop a new business model or paint a portrait of an existing model."
"For organizations whose goals include profitability and growth, money is critical and importantly comes from customers who pay for what fulfills their needs. Thus, for customers to buy proton products or services from an organization, its products or services must embody benefits that satisfy customers' needs. That is, the organization must offer customers the right value proposition. However, a product that meets the needs of one market segment may not meet the needs of another."
"Many startups do not yet have business models. Therefore, one cannot paint a portrait of what one does not know. Consequently, the discovery process is used to determine what should go into the model. For each component, participants try to identify those elements of a business model that stand to make the most contribution to creating and delivering benefits to customers and, importantly, monetizing the benefits."
"Considering the impact of digital technologies on human capital formationso raises the question of relative gains. We have prominently discussed this with regards to skill-biased technological change and subsequent income effects, butso highlighted the distributional effects of digitalization concerning productivity and trade. Elaborating on this cross-cutting issue seems especially fruitful against the backdrop of structural duality within developing economies."
"Moreover, we suggest that digitalization might facilitate harnessinglatent comparative advantages to diversify trade. Digitalization reduces transaction costs which have been identified as one impeding factor to exploiting latent comparative advantages. Hence, it might be valuable for developing countries to re-assess latent comparative advantages related to digitalization-enabled tasks, products and sectors which exhibit higher growth rates compared to traditional tasks, products and sectors (e.g. due to network and scale effects). "
"The pandemic spread has caused unprecedentedly tough quarantine measures and required quick
changes in the organization of work and business
towards distant ones. The new economy that is being formed will include virtual reality thanks to
total digitalization whereas the material reality
will beso changed significantly. "
"Certainly, the digitalization itself can be understood as one of the vivid appearances (main trends) of the change of technological orders together with for instance transition from an internal combustion engine to more advanced engine models (electric, hydrogen) or searching for the ways of non-waste production, new medicine, new forms of or organization."
"Digitalization opens a broad range of exciting possibilities as in any technological revolution but brings, inevitably, a series of
concerns. Digitalization is expected to increase the sustainability of our energy systems, spread electricity to remote areas, and improve the way we it."
"Digital health includes different technological advances such as telehealth and telemedicine. Telehealth is the of electronic information and telecommunication technologies to support and promote long-distance clinical health care, patient and professional health-related education, public health, and health administration."
"Once a database has been built according to the steps described in the previous section, various
topics can be addressed. A technology, a firm, or an individual can be studied in further detail.
Making of the search function in a database wherel documents have been processed using
OCR technique implies thatl documents containing this particular term or name can be identified."
"Digitalization seems to enable a shift toward more historical perspectives as it holds the potential to make data collection and analysis much more resource-efficient. The research related to digital archives described earlier illustrates how the emergence of software, digital photography, OCR-processing, and the creation of a database structure creates considerable productivityimprovements."
"In the case of digital archives, micro-level activities canso be combined with aggregated
observations concerning the state of an organization or a field. Actors can be identified, actions can
be tracked and measured on the micro level, including assessments of their discursive strategies.
Snippets can more easily be found on the micro level and related to aggregated patterns such as
turnover growth, the emergence of brokerage firms, and how they differed from traditional actors
such as banks."
"Automation Cloud enables software applications to be installed not physically in the plant but anywhere through either intra- or internet connection. This enables the of much more powerful computing resources (e.g. parallel computing) and easier remote administration. It cansolow purchasing a solution as a service withoutinvesting inhardware,thus reducing the investment risk."
"Mobility, Unmanned Sites and Remote Operationsl contribute to more automated process operations and control. The main idea is to increase the safety of operations, reduce costs and be able to monitor and interact with the process from anywhere at any time. Upcoming standards e.g. 5G with very low latency should enable geographically distributed control solution components. In principle this could be seen as a pure IT-topic."
"With the recent developments towards internet of things (IoT), we can expect that in the future devices and systems can seamlessly communicate. The most typical IoT-effects are seen in data analytics, where new devices can on-line collect earlier hardly accessible information and feed it into the cloud, where theoretically “unlimited” computing power can be applied for processing the data or optimizing larger-scale problems."
"Similar to biological ecosystems, the digital business ecosystem should be populated by a critical mass of species in order to be attractive for the market and have a number of individuals enough to survive"
"Promoting sustainability and resilience in a business ecosystem, is one of the current concerns in business practice and research. Sustainability in ecology is defined as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain its essential functions and processes, and retain its biodiversity in full measure over the long-term. Resilience is the capacity of an ecosystem to respond to a perturbation or disturbance by resisting damage andrecovering quickly"
Customers can influence the health of business ecosystem through their participation.Customers’ roles such as word-of-mouth (WOM) and boycott are typical examples of customer participation at the business ecosystem level. Such customer participation influences the productivity and robustness of the business ecosystem.
Customers as core members of a business ecosystem interact and influence other members of the business ecosystem.  Word-ofmouth communication occurs among business ecosystem members. Customers exchange messages related to their experiences with others customers as well as with firms in the business ecosystem. WOM communication influences many members of the business ecosystem as well as individual entities like focal firms or keystones.
"business ecosystem lens provides a new perspective on customers’ role in business. As a core member of the business ecosystem, customers have a shared purpose with other members including employees.so, customer participation assumes that customers act as partial employees. such customers possess better knowledge regarding the product or service and perceive some control as a result of their participation. Consequently, customers develop psychological ownership through their participation in business activities, as employees do."
"psychological ownership is a
significant determinant of customer participation in the business ecosystem through
WOM and boycott intention.so, we found that customer socialization has a
significant effect on customer participation in the individual firm, which in turn has
a significant effect on psychological ownership."
"“business ecosystem” is not just a new
term for “environment”. Indeed, the term “ecosystem” has to be fully
articulated with the concepts of ‘business model’ and ‘environment’ to fully
release its potential insights."
"the ecosystem may be defined as the part of the environment with which an organization interacts. Consequently, in a pragmatist view, the ecosystem is performed by the choices—deliberate, emergent or constrained—made by an organization concerning its business model. firms have various choices for navigating nascent ecosystems. They may follow a positioning logic driven by the search for bargaining power, a competency logic driven by their pre-existing capabilities or a bottleneck logic driven by entering bottleneck components of the ecosystem to create value."
"The heightened dynamic environment calls for cooperation, partnership and strategicliances. Resource sharing to create value and the formation of partnerships to promote innovation and enhance financial return are emerging  as can be seen with formalized overbooking collaborations."
"Strong-tie relationships are described by frequent interaction between individuals, entrepreneurs and firms with similar interest. This tends to reinforce and develop insights and new ideas. Weak-tie relationships, however, are characterized by infrequent interactions between casual acquaintances.  Arguably strong network ties facilitate communication, cooperation,
frequent exchanges of information and greater dissemination
of knowledge across the organization."
"networking results significant reductions
in total costs, stable and balanced business operations  and improves innovation. strong-tie relationships are triggered by
a sense of companionship, comfort, security and are part of a multilayered
strategic relationship."
"Business networking ties are significant
in helping firms to understand intra-firm and interfirm
collaboration, the institutional contexts and the provision of timely
and accurate business information. These networks can improve their
financial performance by enabling smaller and independent businesses
to compete more effectively"
" A disruptive innovation’s appeal does not come from improved product
performance; somewhat counterintuitively,disruptive innovations
actually underperform when compared with existing competitors’
primary attributes"
"disruptive innovations are inferior “good enough” products when
compared directly to existing competitors, but their unique set of
attributes modifies the prevailing value proposition in a way that
appeals to some consumers."
" five characteristics of disruptive innovation: 1) Innovation underperforms on attribute valued by mainstream customers, 2) Mainstream customers do not value new attributes of innovation, 3) Innovation is simple and cheaper compared to existing offerings, 4) At introduction, it appeals to low-end price sensitive customer, which incumbents may ignore, and 5) Over time innovation outperforms existing offerings on features mainstream customers value"
" High-end disruptive innovation involves radical
technologies, while low-end disruptive innovation is based on incremental technologies"
"A solution to ensure market equilibrium and serve markets that consist
of people at the bottom of the pyramid, ‘bottom billion’ is to disrupt the
market through disruptive innovation to break the relationship between
supply and demand"
"To manage disruption requires leaders to balance the tension between
exploiting a core business that generates reliable, short-term results, and exploring into new areas where results are uncertain, even if the long-term payoff may
prove to be attractive."
"Scaling isso less of an issue for incremental innovations such as the introduction of a new product or service where the new idea can be integrated into existing structures and processes but for a large firm, scaling a new disruptive business or business model that moves from a
successful experiment to a fully operational business is a moment of both commercial and organizational vulnerability"
"To succeed in the face of disruptive change requires established firms to master three distinct disciplines: ideation, to generate potential new business ideas; incubation, to validate these ideas in the market; and scaling, to reallocate the assets and capabilities needed to grow the new
business"
" disruptive innovation should not be treated solely as a threat or an opportunity; instead, a balanced framework must be established to enable managers to recognize threats and seize opportunities."
" in the face of disruptive innovation, successful companies establish new businesses independent from their core businesses and provide capital and diverse assistance to their new ventures in a step-by-step manner following market development."
"From market perspective, “Disruption” in disruptive innovation is often related to market positioning, instead of the product or technology itself"
"investigation of the technological dimension has provided the following important perspectives: (i) the R&D leading to the creation of technologies for Disruptive innovation may indeed be extremely challenging and is hence suitable as an agenda for use-inspired upstream research in companies as well as in universities and (ii) by creating technology candidates for Disruptive innovation ahead of competitors, the could command a substantial lead in exploiting them for subsequent Disruptive innovations and building unique core competences"
"scholars widely agree that disruptive innovation is characterized tolow
to deliberately change and destabilize the sector’s rules of the game, in order to redefine the competitive framework to the advantage of the disruptor"
"External scale-up factors of the EU Entrepreneurship such as entrepreneurial education and training to support growth and business creation 
and Creation of an environment where entrepreneurs can flourish and grow
with role models and reaching out to specific groups"
"A start-up aiming to become a high-growth company can maximize its speed of progress by keeping these five core dimensions in balance. Customer, Product, Team, Business Model, and Financials."
"The main characteristic of a scale-up company is its focus on rapid growth in terms of turnover, innovation development, and seeking further expansion to foreign markets."
"Functional capabilities that should be taken into account in a
data science and AI organization’s operating model are data providers, IT operations, skilled resources, governance, delivery, and consumers."
"There is no one-size-fits-all operating model for AI and client AI maturity, business size, scope and industry-specific factors such as the geographic spread of data sources will play a part in determining the optimal AI operating model for AI at scale. "
"The main objective of the AI at scale operating model is to create realizable, explainable, and sustainable insight that improves business performance. The operating model plays an important role in structuring, organizing, and governing AI solution delivery to the business, and demonstrating momentum and credibility to solve critical business problems."
"The marginal cost of serving an additional user on many digital networks is, forl purposes, zero, apart from the small incremental cost of computing capacity makes digital business models easier to scale. At the same time, where low entry costs and plentiful capital is often available to digital startups, the entry barriers are thus quite low, resulting in a very large number of entrants into this specific market of startups."
"Mechanisms of the rapid growth of an innovative platform startups are being data-driven, being able to release and launch modifications instantly and being able to swiftly transform novel value-in-use and therefore able to reduce marginal costs for every new customer to close to zero."
"Professional service providers should have the need to grow by giving an increasing knowledge demand in a technological society, putting ever more pressure on the need for expertise in how to manage this knowledge. Professional service startups are characterized by high knowledge intensity, low capital intensity, and professionalized workforces"
"As the scaling within the organization continues, the more complex and time-consuming it becomes. In our experience, most organizations aim for safe paths and start with a pilot project before trying to scale further. We have seen organizations that successfully ran several pilot projects in parallel but not several business units in parallel."
"The golden nugget is to more advanced forms of analytics to make better decisions and become data-driven.
Organizations that have managed to embrace and scale up the usage of advanced analytics are typically in better positions than their competitors with respect to financial and operational results"
"Analytics is used to make better decisions, and scaling analytics is a journey that is done in several dimensions.l scaling attempts with analytics start with a solid of descriptive analytics in place. Do not take a shortcut and jump directly to prescriptive analytics without having both descriptive analytics and predictive analytics in
place."
"Business process management (BPM) supports the creation and capture of value. In a dynamic context, the current approach to BPM appears to be limited and static in the face of the challenges posed by the firm's open innovation (OI) ecosystem."
"BMI is defined as the activity-based perspective of BMs, resulting in changes in an enterprise’s BM that is new to the world or just new to the enterprises under analysis . BMI results in reconfiguration of activities in the existing BM of an enterprise that is new to the market in which enterprise competes . It is a process that deliberately changes the core elements of an enterprise and its business logic"
"Technical advancements within the subject of artificial intelligence (AI) leads towards development of human-like machines, able to operate autonomously and mimic our cognitive behavior. The process of value creation is one of the main segments of business model innovation (BMI) that is clearly connected to AI through its ability to solve complex problems based on large data-sets"
Only if the business model is designed and changed to support the provision of predictive maintenance services can manufacturing enterprises achieve the expected economic benefits and sustainable competitive advantage from the provision of digitalization equipment maintenance services. Numerous studies have shown that business model innovation is a vital leverage to improve the sustainability performance of enterprises
"Business model innovation differs from instrumental innovations (e.g. in processes or
products) in that it is a more systems-oriented approach, aiming at deliberate changes to
how companies create value (Wirtz., 2016). As a consequence, business model
innovation deals with comprehensive activity systems, bringing together various tasks
such as supplier identification and recruitment, value proposition design, development of
new customer channels, new revenue models and many more."
"In   digital   era,   The development of business model innovation relly  on the customer experience, since customer can be connected through digital technology anywhere and any time. Digital  leadership there  isa significant  impact  directly  and  indirecty  through  customer experience orientation in formulating business model innovation."
"A business model broadly describes ‘the way business is done’  by illustrating how a business proposes, creates and delivers and captures value  for the business, customer and wider group of stakeholders. As such, it provides a ‘systemic lens’ to investigate businesses and the ways they operate . A business model is typically depicted by a value proposition (product/service offering), value creation and delivery (how this value is provided e.g., through activities and sales channels) and value capture mechanisms (how money is made and other forms of value are captured)"
"The concepts of BM, BMI, and its relationship with internationalization and entry modes are investigated in this paper. Based on the literature review, a theoretical model is proposed to relate entry modes and the need of business model innovation. The global market can be considered a volatile environment and the internationalization of a through the adoption of any entry mode may lead to the need to innovate or adapt its business model (BM) to better fit specific contexts of international markets. Even though entry modes have been deeply investigated during the last decades, the relation of business model innovation (BMI) and entry modes is a new study subject."
"The concept of business model innovation has been put to the forefront of the debate of how companies may preserve their market position . The present literature of business model innovation mainly focuses on external antecedents, which may pressure companies to engage in business model innovation. This pressure mayso arise through technological disruptions"
"Implementing a new or improved business model that establishes routines to explore and exploit internal and external knowledge sources can affect the existing stock of resources and capabilities for innovation. Building on the existing stock, the new or improved business model can influence how it can be used and combined to generate new stock of resources, capabilities, and knowledge. To implement BMI, policymakers should therefore consider the whole innovation value chain from knowledge generation through conversion to commercialization."
"Moreover, there is a certain relationship between business model innovation and technological innovation. Chesbrough.  believe that an important role that business models can play in early stage research and development (R&D) is to release the potential value of technology and obtain as much value as possible. At the same time, business model innovation canso drive technological innovation , and promote enterprises to produce reliable products to gain competitive advantage."
Business model innovation (BMI) and specifically BMI  that  is  carried  out  by  making   of liances  has by now received little attention in business model and  innovation  literature.  This  is  unsatisfactory  as  networks that cross borders between market players are  growing  rapidly  and  very  often  determine  the  nature of 21st century innovation processes.
"To build an efficient network of worldwide overseas warehouses, cross-border companies developed its overseas warehousing businesses, which include third-party overseas warehousing for medium-sized cross-border e-commerce companies and transhipment services for individuals."
" Cross-border e-commerce firms can achieve secondary distribution capabilities through the overseas warehouses, which is a useful complement to reverse logistics capabilities."
"Cross-border e-commerce can add value by  planning logistics visualisation, such as package tracking to provide re-sending and reassignment services."
 Studies into cross-border enterprise activity conducted in a group of entities near the EU eastern border showed that they did not the advantage offered by their border location to establish cross-border relations.
Cross-border businesses rely on digital communication for success. Organizations that find a way  to communicate effectively withl members from different parts of the world can open up their opportunities by tenfold.
"Information and communication technologies and e-business are making it more difficult for SMEs to develop strategies, necessitating the adoption of a business model that values innovation, change, ambiguity, and uncertainty."
"To implement Internet commerce, SMEs must evaluate variables such as regional market scope, supply chain structure, industry characteristics, management style, ability to innovate, and entrepreneurialism."
"Services trade is increasing at a faster rate than goods commerce, and ICTs like the Internet has been demonstrated to change services into a more individual-oriented, sustainable, and diagonally connected economy."
Relationship service in a cross-border context entails cultural adaptability. Cultural adaptation has the ability to improve the effectiveness of websites and to benefit the buyer/seller relationship.
"Cross-border business organisations' career management procedures are crucial in assuring the organization's cross-border sophistication and the advancement of its managers. Understanding how cross-border managers should deal with a range of workers in a variety of cross-border business situations is essential to managing cross-border relationships. In order to deal with cross-border organisations, a manager must grasp the needs of diverse cultures, as well as the strategic aim of their companies and how to communicate that intent globally."
"Firms must appreciate a worldwide corporate culture in order to comprehend and manage varied cultural values, attitudes, and behaviours. Culture and values, as well as shared assumptions, can be examined at two levels of an organization's culture. Understanding each element is essential to comprehending an organization and its managers' behaviour. Importantly, the organization's power base is mirrored in how certain activities are carried out."
"Chinese consumers prefer to buy from the cross-border platform because the online price of similar products is cheaper compared to physical stores. Theyso have better incomes and want higher living standards. Hence, imported branded items are more popular among them. "
"The cross-border activities might be complex because of cultural and institutional differences between markets. However, this complexityso becoming an opportunity for multinational companies to merge and developed. "
"Multination Enterprises (MNEs) cause-related marketing (CRM) to build their reputation and make it stronger to enter new markets, which is through cross-border acquisitions (CBAs). "
Limited items availability makes Chinese's shoppers more eager to find and search for products. Consumer's concerns about buying branded items that are not authenticso makes them prefer to buy the products directly from the source.
"In a complex cross-border activitis scenario, the researchers recommends that, there should be integration limination between the acquirer and target for a better post acquisition performance. However, it might not work in certain cases."
The firms extract above-normal returns from cross-border investments by internalizing host-country market imperfections when their firm-specific assets cannot find comparable value elsewhere. The results from internalization are expected to be capitalized into the higher value of the which reflects that investment decisions improve the ability of the to expand by taking benefit from the systemic advantages inherent in a multinational network
"There are several important factors that have an impact on the value captured by the acquirers in cross border businesses such as size, leverage, international experience of the acquirers, prior presence in the host country, the relative size of the target, the stake acquired in the target (controlling or non-controlling), an acquirer's corporate governance structure"
"In cross-border business, the firms can add value with co-specialization in which an asset owner is not aware of the value of its assets to other parties with assets whose value will be enhanced through combination.This happens because the markets for co-specialized assets are necessarily thin, and are frequently global in nature. This enables systemic innovation to proceed and tolow value appropriation in multi-invention contexts by combining the co-specialized assets."
"Multinational Enterprises capture more value by creating new markets through their cross-border activities, which involves not just solving existing market failures, butso creating new markets through the entry of competitors, competition with local players, and careful dealings with foreign governments."
"In the case of international businesses, organizational routines, governance systems, and business models cannot generally be protected by the instruments of IP law and the absence of secure property rights is likely to handicap the operation of the market which indicates that foreign direct investment is likely an important vehicle by which firms capture value from innovation."
"Cross-border transactions have become more and more popular around the world, but they still have risks and challenges, like the lack of a fair profitlocation system. To address these issues, we propose a new framework for the transaction system with the support of blockchain technology."
"In a cross-border transaction system, each area or country may have its local business bank, which is trusted by the residents, as well as the central bank or government's financial regulation departments, which can share its information in real-time via the distributed ledger technology."
"Cross-border online shopping needs a lot of financial support and the traditional cross-border payment service is too complex, which hinders the development of cross-border business. In the asymmetric consortium blockchain system, many participants will be involved in cross-border transactions, including consumers, retailers, business banks, regulators, and the currency exchange market."
"International mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have long been used by multinational enterprises (MNEs) to quickly expand abroad or penetrate new foreign markets, but sometimes because of cultural differences M&A outcomes can be disappointing"
Cultural differences do not automatically cause tensions. But when tensions do arise – often due to situational factors such as lack of communication or poor performance – people blame many of the organizational difficulties they encounter on cultural heterogeneity – on the presence of others who seem different – rather than to the context within which these problems took place
"New companies committed to scale need to operate across borders, innovate relentlessly"
 The multiplicity of critically relevant external stakeholders necessitates the formulation of multiple valuable propositions 
"Resources are the raw material of organizational success , that is, anything that Ban organization can draw on to accomplish its goals.  In their review of RBT in marketing, highlight four market-based resources: 
(1) knowledge, (2) innovation, (3) relationships, and (4) brands."
"Cross-functional coordination can help a incorporate innovation resources into its CVP and offer new ways of addressing customer problems or identify solutions to entirely new problems. 
"
" Seen through this RBT lens, the CVP is more than an operational advertising concept; it is a strategic communication device conveying the firm’s core strategy decision "
"value, and price are two different, elemental characteristics of a market offering (i.e., changing the price of the offering does not change the value of it for the customer)."
A value proposition is thus the outcome of a reciprocal process that takes place between a company and one or more of its external stakeholders. 
"Telehealth and mHealth (Mobile Health) systemslow physicians to easily access health-related medical information anytime, anywhere, and to take major decisions remotely on the clinical care of patients in distant areas."
"The healthcare industry in Africa seems to be an ideal context for implementing successful Creating Shared Value (CSV) strategies through the adoption of disruptive business models that might improve patients’ access to affordable healthcare services, support healthcare industry sustainability, and help innovative firms achieve value creation goals and foster social progress."
"With the widespread of smartphones in the medical workplace, software applications with the ability to translate between languages represent a potentially convenient and inexpensive adjuvant to professional interpretation services. It mayso be a useful option for clinicians working in rural areas devoid of professional interpreter services"
"The main value proposition will be based on proximity to the patient, close supervision, regular one-to-one care attentions, empathy, and on the of mobile or remote patient monitoring devices."
"To establish the foundations for a relational perspective on disruption, we begin with Teece’s (1986) work, which emphasized the critical role of complementary assets in the successful commercialization of innovations."
"Digital medical technologiesso facilitate information exchange and collaboration between hospitals and laboratories, andlow healthcare professionals to access information related to a patient'slergy, even if the patient is unconscious"
"Mechanisms should be put in place to facilitate further consultation among the various digital health stakeholders, including patients and caregivers. The rights and responsibilities of the various stakeholders involved in connected digital health shouldso be better defined and highlighted."
"These business models often lead to industry convergence, disrupt industries’ incumbents, and create new dimensions of customer experiences, customer expectations, and innovative interactions with customers and value networks through social media, communities of experts, open innovation models, and digital transformation models."
"Blockchain and its distributed ledger technology may give patients more control of their data; improve reliability, security and accuracy of data recording, and help reduce costs. Blockchain-based electronic Health systems may create significant improvements in medical records management."
"Although difficult to measure, the patient-physician relationship has diagnostic and therapeutic benefits. Understanding what symptoms are typical for a patient can help a physician determine the difference between benign and serious pathologies and a patient may disclose more details to a physician they know well."
"Patient Engagement Mobile Apps involve the of wearable sensors, smartphone apps, and other mobile monitoring and communication devices to provide consumers with interactive care education and outreach services."

"As with traditional modalities of healthcare delivery, telehealth relies heavily on reports of patient satisfaction because the patients are the only source of information that can report how they were treated and if the treatment received met the patients’ expectations of care"
"In order to identify opportunities for innovation, firms need to scan their digital environment. This involves gathering information on new digital devices, channels, and associated user behaviors."
Firms need to keep up-to-date with and analyze the progress of digital technology and associated usage patterns. This is done through gathering intelligence on which new hardware devices are on their way to market
"User-driven innovation identifies business opportunities and develops new concepts by involving different groups of customers and/or potential users. Within user driven innovation, design thinking is gaining popularity as an approach for doing business innovation. Design thinking is defined as a user-centered innovation approach based on problem solving and a process of repeated iterations between the three creative phases of inspiration, ideation and implementation."
Digitization of businesseslows entrepreneurs and managers to reimagine new forms of collaboration to enhance the value creation potential of their business models.
"Digital products and services must not only be efficient to and easy to learn, butso provide a rich user experience. Such user experience can be measured on its levels of usability, aesthetics, and engagement."
"Tweaking application value means the willingness or the ability of making small changes in the venture’s innovative technology that deliver correspondingly larger improvements in the value of the market offering to the customer. It increases customers’ motivation to cooperate with the technology startup in pilot projects, because pilot customers receive additional focus and the cooperation will lead to product improvements from the customer’s perspective. "
"In order to reap the benefits of digital innovation, firms need to acquire new skills both internally and externally while establishing new digital roles. In doing so, firms should promote continuous learning of the unique properties of digital technologies in order to secure dynamic innovation teams."
"The granularity is defined as a feature that captures the divisibility of digital products. The divisibility means the components of digital products can be divided into segments and reconstructed into different styles pertain to special customer’s preferences. If the digital products have high differentiation ability, it can be shaped into more products than which one with low differentiation ability. The differentiation ability of digital products is increasing with its granularity increasing, which means the product will shape more styles in a product’s series while their granularity is high"
"A traditional success metric for new projects, even today, is return on investment. But ROI doesn’t help you understand what value a project adds for customers, at least not directly. Further, to calculate it you need to estimate both investments and returns, which is precisely what you haven’t figured out yet. What you need to do instead is identify metrics that are more closely linked to the specific improvements you hope digital initiatives will bring about."
"Within an ecosystem, different members (including incumbents) may be affected differently leading to heterogeneity of responses. Such heterogeneity within the ecosystem offers the ‘disruptor’ an opportunity to frame its innovation to attract the support of at least some of its members. This leads us to a framing perspective."
"While collaborative relationships have been shown to have a positive impact on innovative performance, it depends on the nature of the partner(s) involved (Faems., 2005)."
"Hereby, banks are under massive pressure to transform their approaches and business models to a more customer-centric approach in order to remain competitive. The traditional institution has felt the disruption and is working towards changing its business model from product-centric to customer-centric [37]. Similarly Mărăcine. [49] suggest that five main areas exist where FinTechs can provide improvements in business models for the banks: introducing specialized platforms, covering neglected customer segments, improving customer selection, reduction of the operating costs of the banks, and optimisation of the business processes of the banks."
"Each stakeholder group has unique needs and objectives. The multiplicity of critically relevant external stakeholders necessitates the formulation of multiple valuable propositions that target very different groups with dissimilar roles, needs, and priorities"
"Digital innovations, characterized by convergence and generativity (Yoo., 2012) are blurring boundaries between industries and sectors (e.g., Education and Entertainment), consumers and producers (e.g., Sharing Economy), humans and machines (e.g., Artificial Intelligence), products and services (e.g., Servitization), and the physical and the digital (e.g., the Internet of Things)."
"Managers can representations in communication to represent value and thus facilitate communication with the external surroundings while avoiding misunderstandings. Communication can be used to confront representations and better coordinate dialogues, as different types of visualizations can inspire different kinds of cognitive processes."
"This viewso enables the categorization of organizational capabilities into operational or dynamics. In perspective, operational capabilities include the means and practices of efficiently configuring existing resources into products and services, whereas dynamic capabilities reflect the explorative side of the organization"
"Thus, successful value capture calls for the design of appropriate governance mechanisms to ensure that value creation is greater than the cost of realizing that value and that the value surplus is distributed fairly among partne"
"However, it is important to note that value capture extends beyond contractual and legal agreements. For example, when partners are focused on value-in-use as the basis for value capture, trust between partners becomes necessary support for control-based relationships centered on contracts and other legal agreements"
"Another key task for value capture in this phase was deciding on the profit formula. This meant taking the initial estimates from the first phase further by clearly defining how and under what conditions each party would profit from the agreement. Specifically, agreements must be formulated on how costs and revenues will flow under defined operating conditions and in various scenarios. In essence, such a mechanism defined the governance structure that will facilitate a smoothly operating outcome-based service. During this phase, value-capture activities became more quantifiable and concrete as operational routines were fleshed out. Thus, issues such as risk assessment, revenue flow and cost structure, and the development of appropriate outcome indicators became central subtasks."
"A development team with OA has the ability to handle uncertain situations by integrating both the internal and external capability of the organization. For example, agile development teams can detect changes in technology and customer demand and rapidly respond to these situations to manipulate the NPD process [17] for the purpose of improving the competitive advantage of the through innovation. Hence, it is vital that an organization adopt greater agility in the process of developing new products to cope with unpredictable situations"
"LO (LEARNING ORIENTATION) is another key activity of dynamic capability related to seizing and reconfiguration, two elements that play a role in fostering organizations to become more agile. It involves creating and adopting knowledge to enhance competitive advantage [46]. The elements of LO include shared vision, learning commitment, knowledge sharing, and open mindedness [48]. LO focuses on process mastery, but learning isso assessed in terms of success or outcome [49], [50]. According to Akgun. [22], organizational adaptation is seen as the dynamic process of continuous learning, which leads to increasing innovativeness by offering new product values to the market."
"The introductory and theignment space are suggested to complement the common exploratory, ideation, and prototyping and testing spaces of Design Thinking to appropriately accommodate the Circular Business Model Innovation context. The framework comprises a Circular Business Model Innovation toolbox (in the form of a system diagram, an idea map, Circular Business Model principles, best practice exemplars and business model elements) that is complemented with innovation techniques of a general character to apply throughout the innovation process."
"A value proposition is an explicit promise made by a company to its customers that it will deliver a particular bundle of value creating benefits. While trying to create a new value proposition one should increase the customer benefits or enhance the existing services for better shopping experience. In this case, the long checkout procedure considered as one of the main reasons for cart abandonment, which have greater rate up to 70 percent."
"Obtain continuous responses from the staff, incorporating their mind into the new process of change to ensure the internal processes are smoothly running according to the plan. By ensuring that a company strictly follows these recommendations and adopts the recommended value proposition and implementation strategy, they should stimulate a competitive advantage, which not only will help mitigate the competitive threat but shall escalate the brand image as the leader in the sector."
"Consumers are looking for economic benefits such as huge price savings; lowering production/marketing cost when consumer uses Mobile Social Networking to make appointments and place orders. Online reviewlows consumer easily compare products/services, which save costs, leading to perceived purchase reliability, it is the strongest predictor of loyalty behavior. Convenience of search, access, evaluate, transact, possession, purchase and easy accessibility are two critical customer-perceived value for Mobile Social Networking leading to repurchase intension. Consumers preferred to identify people through phone number, easier to be found and easy access compared to user-ID verification and acceptance."
"The paradigm shift towards considering the significance of data as a strategic resource as well as an external view with inter-organizational data sharing are phenomena that just begin to gain research attention in the context of data governance. The rise of ecosystems underlines the need to review data governance from an inter-organizational perspective, as novel forms of collaboration between various actors lack concepts in enforcing governance mechanisms for data and challenge established practices. The dynamics within ecosystems are more complicated and diverse because value-creation processes, governance and ownership structures over data become less transparent."
"The subject of analysis in the intra-organizational perspective lies on how to set up organizational structures, governance mechanisms to improve data quality, manage resources across a single organization and define guidelines for the management of data. From an internal perspective of an organization, the execution of decision rights for the management and of data manifests itself within organizational structures and hierarchies. They ensure that relevant guidelines and principles regarding data assets are in place and monitored"
"Users of platforms have limited authority and control mechanisms. Platform users as in case Beta need to consider the implications that arise from the interaction with external platforms e.g. mandatory data standards or authoritative entry barriers (fees for platform participation). Beyond the influential sphere of an organization or platform, little is known about who uses the data for which purpose, and with whom the data is shared subsequently in the process. Thus, the influence of authority for the individual actor within an ecosystem might be limited."
"SMEs seeking growth need to consider early and rapid internationalization as many national markets are not only highly competitive, butso too small, mature, and isolated for lucrative growth.though SMEs can derive scaling benefits from expansion both within their national market and across national boundaries, the latter is likely to provide them with more benefits. By expanding across borders, they can gain access to new markets, achieve economies of scale and scope, engage in beneficial learning opportunities, and utilize low-cost factor inputs,l relevant aspects in business model scaling. "
"Customer relationships are crucial for the internationalization of SMEs. Efficient customer relationship management contributes to business growth, and that scaling requires deep engagement and communications with customers. Specifically, scaling companies need to track andign their value propositions to customers and communicate both internally and externally to deliver high value to customers before, during, and after they products or consume services. Growth firms emphasize personalized contacts with customers and aim at improving customer satisfaction, rather than reducing costs."
"Partners provide an SME with knowledge acquisition and learning, as well as important resources. Scalability may require finding new distribution channel partners and outsourcing non-core technology development or service provision to third parties. Digital technologies enable integration and connectivity with third-party services that are provided by global value network partners through application programming interfaces. A SME’s “digital networking capability” becomes of ultimate importance for its growth; in other words, SMEs need to co-create value with various digitally connected partners."
"An organization’s success depends on the availability and orchestration of valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable assets, which enable the implementation of value-creating strategies capable to generate rents. Specifically, a company can obtain a sustainable competitive position by acquiring and controlling the resources perceived as strategic and consequently developing firm-specific capabilities that are highly dependent on the types of resources accumulated"
"In addition to being used to reengineer business processes, create new products, developing new ways of engaging stakeholders and communities, this knowledge can be effectively deployed for developing new Business Models. In particular, the presence of a trained staff who has the ability to technically handle Business Development and recognize its importance as a valuable source of business information, together with the widespread diffusion of a data-driven corporate culture and knowledge management systems capable of collecting, storing, sharing and utilizing the obtained information, gives firms the opportunity to implement new value creation mechanisms."
"The need to rethink the optimal mix of product and service business has been identified, since the digital part of a hybrid solution isways a service. Besides, Business Model patterns which were reserved to digital industries until now, are becoming relevant to traditional good sales industries. Consequently, the Industry 4.0 is pushing companies to a change from product to service mindset. Moreover, many researchers have suggested that manufacturing firms in developed economies should expand their role in the value chain by extending their products with services so they do not have to compete solely on manufacturing cost. The result is the so-called product- service system (PSS) concept, a framework describing the integrated development, realization, and offering of specific product-service bundles as a solution for the customer. As a result, suppliers, customers, and other partners become part of a networked ecosystem around the CPS."
"To define the value created and shared in the firm’s innovation ecosystem as a process, we focus not only on the implications of value activities as a strategic resource but we rather adopt a much broader perspective of the value system. The model offers a new way of analyzing three frameworks which stimulate this broader process (value chain, OI and BM), pointing to create an efficient BPM structure across the firm’s innovation ecosystem. Managerial improvements can benefit from this wider perspective by raising quality of open integrated processes, understanding and streamlining distinctive value system operations, implementing measurements and controls by continuous improvement on the of unique resources (subset of primary and secondary activities) "
"Nevertheless, this new industrial paradigm is transforming the current ways of value creation, since it involves changes in the technical and production developments, which in turn has brought extensive organizational consequences and opportunities providing more cooperative environments, improved customer relationships or new product and services offers. Consequently, new and adapted business models are needed."
"SBMI faces the challenge of exploring, brokering, and re-aligning organizational boundaries of different stakeholders. However, the processes through which businesses navigate such boundary work for SBMI remains little explored. We address this gap by providing an empirical, detailed description of the boundary work processes for SBMI as a basis for further theoretical and practical work. "
"The need to rethink the optimal mix of product and service business has been identified, since the digital part of a hybrid solution isways a service. Besides, Business Model patterns which were reserved to digital industries until now, are becoming relevant to traditional good sales industries. Consequently, the Industry 4.0 is pushing companies to a change from product to service mindset [11, 12]. Moreover, many researchers have suggested that manufacturing firms in developed economies should expand their role in the value chain by extending their products with services so they do not have to compete solely on manufacturing cost. The result is the so-called product- service system (PSS) concept, a framework describing the integrated development, realization, and offering of specific product-service bundles as a solution for the customer. As a result, suppliers, customers, and other partners become part of a networked ecosystem around the CPS."
"The horizontal and vertical integration of the value chain and the related interoperability expands firms’ traditional boundaries due to the organization and the stakeholders’ network. New actors arise and the role of existing ones is changing. As a consequence, new ways of creating and offering value through ecosystems that goes beyond individual value chains are raising. Accordingly, traditional manufacturing companies oriented to product sales, feel increasingly compelled to revise their existing Business Models in response to new competitive dynamics and to tap into those Industry 4.0 inspired opportunities"
"This context opens up inroads to make manufacturing more responsive to user-driven design and toign it better with customer value creation processes and contexts. From this approach, companies need to develop new capabilities in both, learning more about their customers (using digital capabilities to obtain information about customers, promoting evidence-based decision making, developing integral customer experiences, etc.) and becoming more of an ecosystem beyond individual value chains (become great at building partnerships with new stakeholders). Thus, the Industry 4.0 provides opportunities to create new and more flexible value propositions to respond to customer demands such as the provision of individualized products and even batch-size-line production. Moreover, an enhanced customer orientation is shown by the expansion of innovative service offering."
"This transformation represent an incremental innovation that optimizes the actual business without involving big changes. New enabling technologies such as Big Data, Cloud Computing, Collaborative Robots, Additive Manufacturing, Artificial Vision or Augmented Reality are introduced just to optimize the value creation architecture (key resources and activities) due to increasing efficiency and improving performance (reducing costs, time and failures, employee training, etc.). This could be the first step for traditional manufacturing companies to embrace the Industry 4.0 without addressing high risks. "
"proposes a completely new Business Model based on new technologies focused on Big Data, Cloud Computing, Intelligent Sensorisation and Embedded Systems, among others, thatlow to offer innovative and smart goods and services (e.g. remote installation of maintenance or activation of product upgrades). Thus, a disruptive innovation that provides the change ofmostl the elements of the Business Model is needed. This kind of new Business Models might provide the opportunity to firms to diversify or expand their markets. Itso could be implemented parallel to the actual Business Model. In this way, the company could experiment with the new Business Model while the old one still provides revenues."
"More research is required to understand the process of experimentation with novel and impactful business models. First, what are the boundary conditions under which the experimentation process can produce useful outcomes in terms of high novelty and/or impact for startups or incumbent firms Second, we need to know more about the details of the process itself, such as content, sequencing, types of participants, pace, and rhythm. For instance, how should entrepreneurs or managers decide on which asumptions to test first? "
"Sustainable business model innovation is a relatively nascent field of research. This research has reviewed the field and has synergised definitions for the key underlying concepts and identi- fied a research gap in the implementation of the business model innovation process, in the challenges of this process, and in the tools to address these challenges. Based on the research gap we have formulated a research question and broke it down into five sub-questions. These research questions aim to generate descrip- tive knowledge about the process organisations undergo to move into new, sustainable business models, both in the start-up and corporate context. While this comprises the development of an entirely new business model from scratch in the context of start- ups, it describes the transformation from one business model to another, the acquisition and integration of new business models, or the process of business model diversification in a corporate setting"
"This model proposes a radical innovation of the actual Business Model which follows the purpose of focusing on the core business (key or distinctive activities of the firm), sharing the uncertainty with other agents or achieving new required skills and resources from associates, due to the introduction of technologies such as Big Data, Cloud Computing, Augmented Reality or Virtual Reality. By this way, the focal firm’s value creation process is linked with the stakeholders’ processes. Moving from value chains to ecosystems and, in consequence, increasing stakeholders’ knowledge, requires a radical change in many of the Business Model elements (key activities, channels and relationships) with both customer and partnerships. As a result, new ways of capturing value should be defined too."
"Companies with disruptive value propositions target emerging customer segments rooted in low-end or new markets. Hence, companies continuously innovate their value propositions to move upmarket and attract an increasing share of the mainstream market.. Market disruption occurs when the business model’s value proposition is brought into the mainstream market. Thus, DI is a market-side phenomenon related to how appealing a value proposition is initially to niche customers, and how a company is able to continuously innovate the value proposition to attract larger shares from mainstream customer segments."
"It is prudent to focus specifically on value propositions because it has been demonstrated that they have been successfully developed and communicated by less than 10% of companies (Frow & Payne, 2011), indicating the extent of their untapped potential. The development of value propositions is associated with innumerable benefits, especially in a servitization setting that demands new capabilities and management practices. In practice, servitization is fundamentally about changing seller- and product-based value propositions to customer- and service-based proposals."
"Building on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the extant literature suggests that value propositions can form a hierarchy with economic value propositions at the most fundamental level, followed by functional, emotional, and, finally, symbolic value propositions. Economic value propositions aim to appeal to consumers through price-based value, which is defined as the lowest price among competitive offerings or the best trade-off between benefits and sacrifices. Functional value propositions appeal to consumers with promises of functional, utilitarian, or physical product performance and benefits that can solve consumers’ problems in efficient, effective, and convenient ways. Emotional value propositions aim to arouse positive feelings and affective states in consumers. And symbolic value propositions promise consumers to deliver positive consumption meanings, whether personal or social. In other words, self-expression, social value, and the meanings behind consumption are major drivers of consumption behavior."
"A value proposition reflects the overall objective of a Business Model (BM) and orchestrates other BM components to create, deliver, and capture value.though value propositions should be used to shape other components of BMs (in a topdown manner), the current literature too often takes the opposite route by suggesting that value propositions are derived from other BM components."
"A concept that supports predicting the effect of innovation on business model values. This concept redefines the value proposition logic in business model innovations with five primary variables: business dependence structure, business value dominance, innovation dynamics, innovation domains, and innovation-resources-agility"
"Value propositions are vital for facilitating investments and business transactions with external stakeholders , the MaaS strategy and preparedness are utilized to guide dialogue with relevant stakeholders. The goal is to define the role of relevant authorities in enabling the transition. The guided emergence of an ecosystem that can generate competitive MaaS services often depends on some changes to legislation and mutual agreements between partners involved. "
"A new company committed to scaling their company value rapidly must develop value propositions for diverse parties. This includes not just identifying value propositions for customers, butsoigning these value propositions with scaling initiatives, and activities that the new company carries out to scale rapidly. This is reported as a major challenge worldwide, which we surmise is one of the main reasons why most new companies do not scale their company value rapidly.  "
"Organizations should clearly articulate, and, when needed, change the value proposition – the value created for users by an offering based on technology. A remarkable value proposition focusses on jobs, pains, and gains that matter to customers and achieves those exceedingly well. It is vital to identify how the organization helps customers perform a specific job thatternative offerings do not address. The value proposition dimension contains a portfolio of solutions for customers and how they are offered. The dominant business model is vulnerable to anyone who can technology to create a better value proposition for multiple stakeholders."
"The concept of a “customer value proposition” is indigenous to marketing. The term “value proposition” was originally conceived as a proposition for customers, thus, in our view, it clearly comes from marketing. Since then, as you point out, the concept has been adopted in several other disciplinary areas. The concept has mainly been applied in human resource management through the concept of an “employee value proposition”, and in the field of strategy as a component of the business model."
"A business ecosystem is comprised of a set of partners that contribute to the value proposition of the ecosystem’s focal firm. An innovation ecosystem is anchored on the innovation that enables customers to the end-to-end product, with a functional goal to enable technology development and innovation. It includes three sub-ecosystems: science, technology, and business innovation. Finally, a platform ecosystem is comprised of a platform and the applications that interoperate with it. There are two types of platform ecosystems: 1) innovation platforms and 2) transactional platforms"
"The challenge for organizations lies in defining strategies for value generation from the large amount of available data sets. In this article, we discussed how to retrieve value from data and introduced a systematic process that analytics projects follow. First, we described the fundamental building blocks for value creation: business need, data, infrastructure, and analytics."
"What creates value for one stakeholder (for example, a customer), who will acquire a customised product and subsequent service to get a job done is unlikely to beigned with the value of another stakeholder (for example, an investor), who might see a higher short-term return on investment as valuable instead. Thus, working with stakeholders that have seemingly different goals tends to increase a firm’s difficulty to grasp and incorporate disparate stakeholder value interpretations"
"Companies whose dominant business model is ecosystem driver — in both B2B and B2C domains, such as energy management, home ownership, and financial services — experienced revenue growth approximately 27 percentage points higher than the average for their industries, and had profit margins 20 percentage points above the average for their industries, according to our research.2 That 2019 global survey of 1,311 executivesso found that successful drivers achieve outsized results by attracting the partners needed to provide complementary — and competing — products and services that make their ecosystems seamless “one-stop shopping” destinations for customers."
"Four basic elements underlie a structuralist approach to ecosystems. Collectively they characterize the configuration of activities and actors required for a value proposition to materialize. Activities, which specify the discrete actions to be undertaken in order for the value proposition to materialize. Actors, which are the entities that undertake the activities. A single actor may undertake multiple activities; conversely, multiple actors may undertake a single activity. Positions, which specify where in the flow of activities across the system actors are located and characterize who hands off to whom. Links, which specify transfers across actors. The content of these transfers can vary—matériel, information, influence, funds. Critically, these links need not have any direct connection to the focal actor."
"The main theoretical premise for ecosystem research is the simultaneous presence of complementarities and interdependencies between actors. Complementarities between actors stem from the fact that the functions performed by their respective offers help to create or enhance the user value proposition. Interdependencies between actors stem from the fact that their offers are connected within a system-level architecture. While complementarities represent an economic relationship between offers in terms of the potential for value creation, interdependencies represent a structural relationship between offers in terms of how they are connected for the value to be created and how a change in one offer may affect the contribution of other offers towards value creation."
"A key aspect of research on ecosystems is to identify the bottlenecks in the ecosystem stemming from innovations in technologies and business models and to illustrate how they impact firms (Adner and Kapoor 2016; Kapoor and Furr 2015). It isso important to consider how firms maylocate resources to resolve bottlenecks in their ecosystems through R&D investments,liances, or even integration into the activities underlying the bottleneck component (Ethiraj 2007 Adner and Kapoor 2016; Hannah 2016; Zobel. 2017). Other strategic choices entail choosing markets or technologies where bottlenecks are either relatively easily resolvable or where firms’ control over the bottleneck component may provide it with a source of rents (Baldwin 2018b). Finally, an important implication of the existence of bottlenecks in an ecosystem is that firms would need to develop architectural knowledge not only at the level of the product (Henderson and Clark 1990) butso at the level of the ecosystem. Such knowledge can enable firms to recognize bottlenecks and can provide an important source of competitive advantage as evidence through Edison’s success with electric lighting (Hughes 1993)."
"Many ecosystems are organized around a central platform-based architecture that serves as a foundation for firms to offer complementary products or services. There are several important differences between a product-based and a platform-based ecosystem. Platform-based ecosystems are orchestrated by the owner of the platform, who creates the platform architecture and sets the rules for complementors to participate in the ecosystem (e.g., Gawer and Cusumano 2002; McIntyre and Srinivasan 2017; Baldwin, 2018d). Accordingly, theignment structure between the platform and the complementors is determined by the platform owner. In contrast, theignment structure between the product and complementors is typically mutually determined."
"The activities, actors, positions, and links are stable; to the extent that there is change, it is at the level of individual actors or dyads (e.g., new products launched through established channels; rivalry among actors in the same positions) rather than affecting the structuralignment of multilateral positions. In such settings, the ecosystem has the taken-for-granted character of routine-as-truce (i.e., Nelson & Winter, 1982). It is when innovation requires a change in the configuration of these elements that the ecosystem becomes apparent and where consideration of ecosystem dynamics becomes critical for crafting and understanding strategy."
"Asl of this suggests, a strong partnering capability is required to successfully grow digital ecosystems. This capability must be designed to support digital partnering, which is not the same as the traditional handshake and bespoke partnering of the physical world. Traditional partnering often includes exclusive relationships, long-term contracts, and deep integrations,l of which take time to establish and require strategic commitment. Digital partnering creates growth by adding more products and customers via digital connections with other companies that enable fast response to customer needs. It requires the ability to determine and agree with partners about who will create value, how revenue will be apportioned, and what data will be shared; itso requires the capacity to quickly add partners’ products and services via plug-and-play connections that offer immediate order and payment processing, and sometimes delivery as well."
"a critical strategic choice for complementors is whether to specialize in one particular platform ecosystem or leverage multiple platforms. Conventional wisdom, and much of the literature on multihoming—that is, the decision of complementors to participate in one or multiple platform ecosystems (e.g., Bresnahan., 2015b; Landsman and Stremersch, 2011)—would suggest that complementors should exploit the market opportunities as much as possible; hence, they should expand their market reach across platform ecosystems and product spectrums to benefit from economies of scale. Other scholars haveso advanced that complementor firms can obtain benefits from economies of scope by leveraging shared resources to increase the variety of product offerings across different product categories (Yoo., 2010; Tiwana, 2015). However, opposing findings highlight the potential trade-offs of product design (co)specialization that complementors face when choosing to develop their products for multiple platform ecosystems (Cennamo., 2018). Indeed, these trade-offs raise questions of whether and to what extent complementors should expand the scale and scope of their product offerings within and across platform ecosystems."
"Our analysis reveals that complementors face a trade-off regarding their scale- and scope-enhancement strategies: they are better off either specializing in one product category and exploiting potential economies of scale across multiple platform ecosystems or specializing in one platform ecosystem and exploiting potential economies of scope by expanding their product offerings across multiple product categories. In other words, for optimal performance, complementors should increase their investments and efforts within a specific product category and expand its scale across various platform ecosystems—what we call “category specialization”—or they should increase their investments and efforts within a single platform ecosystem while achieving scope benefits across various product categories in that platform ecosystem—what we call “platform ecosystem specialization.”"
"Designed ecosystems like Nespresso's are increasingly important, owing to the convergence of three big structural changes in our economy. The first is an unprecedented rollback of regulations protecting firms that once had the exclusive privilege of serving particular customer needs. As those protections fall, organizations in other domains are free to partner to provide more-integrated offerings, as when accountancies team up with law firms. The second change is a blurring of the separation between products and services because of regulatory changes and digitization. The latter hasso led to offerings with more-modular structures whose components can be recombined in new ways, which in turn has encouraged the rise of product-service bundles provided by networks of interdependent suppliers. The third change involves technology that is revolutionizing how firms can serve their customers. Our dependence on mobile devices,ong with the internet's influence on buying patterns, has dramatically expanded the possibilities for linking previously unrelated goods and services -- reinforcing the effects of the first two changes."
"New companies committed to scale need to operate across borders, innovate relentlessly, profitably adopt emerging technologies, and execute capital investment programs that enable them to meet aggressive growth objectives. The successful operations of such companies depend on their constructive engagement with multiple external stakeholder groups. Each stakeholder group has unique needs and objectives. The multiplicity of critically relevant external stakeholders necessitates the formulation of multiple valuable propositions that target very different groups with dissimilar roles, needs, and priorities."
"focus shifts into further scaling the revenue model and associated digital services while ensuring itlows sufficient profitability. A first key activity is implementing a modular approach to scaling. A key revenue model challenge for the firms we studied were that most advanced digital services are not easily upscaled, i.e., sold to many different customers, due to the need for high degrees of customization. As a response, firms need to work with core modules that can be adapted to various local contexts. For example, a subscription payment model can have different levels whichlows for it to be adapted to varying customer needs. Similarly, at certain global markets, subscription fees may be complemented with add-on expert consulting services to ensure that the digital services are properly implemented and used to realize the intended KPIs for customers"
"The provider and customer worked jointly to define the value proposition by progressively achievingignment between identifying value creation opportunities and agreeing on value distribution. A central goal was to identify a corroborated concept (i.e., mutually agreed) for the outcome-based service, which can create significant value and ensure 
that the value thus created can be profitably captured 
by both provider and customer"
"In terms of innovation, value is created through the processes of inventing, developing, producing, and delivering new market offerings that create turnover. Therefore,  receivers  define  value  based  on  their  perceptions  of  the  potential  usefulness  of  the  exchanged  resource  for  addressing  their  needs.  "
"Communication of value through carefully crafted value propositions can differentiate a supplier, potentially conveying those attributes that offer a unique customer solution . Supplier and customer work together to share value insights and craft reciprocal value propositions that reflect a value in perspective. It is suggested that this process is important , as the dialogue required for developing this detailed, twoway understanding forges stronger relationships"
"Facilitating value creation represents the operations level of 
managing CVPs, in that it connects the company-designed mecha nisms for co-creation of value to where the customers actually live or do business, the contexts in which they assess their options. Firms should possess the fullest possible understanding of how their customers perceive value in their own context, and they should that insight to develop the best possible tools for customers’ management of value. It isways essential to understand what kind of value is created and for whom, through what kinds of resources and what kinds of mechanisms, from the customer and company angle both."
"Value capture tasks include  designing the value offering and deciding the profit formula to agree on a mutually beneficial business model. It involves the concrete design of equipment and service activities in terms of scope andlocation, and 
the formulation of delivery-process descriptions and 
expected roles so that the defined outcome-based ser vice was translated into a signed contract. This phase 
placed higher demands on the ability of partners to 
negotiate so that the benefits and theignment of 
value-creation and value-capture activities could be 
realized"
"If Internet startup customers in the 1990s gained value from brand reputation and quality assurance, customers in the 2000s gained value from security services and privacy protection provided by each startup. In the 2010s, customers gained trust value from security services and legitimacy. Customers seem to care increasingly about privacy and security, as, the more the world modernizes and technology develops, the more we are threatened by possible information leaks"
"Changing the value proposition to adopt more sustainability will lead to developing,enabling, and leveraging certain capabilities within the that would eventually lead to improving the performance. It  will improve the firm’s performance for supply-side reasons by developing sustainability-related capabilities that might help in discovering or creating new markets and sources of competitive advantage. a sustainable value proposition will lead to an improvement in performance due to demand-side reasons. According to the demand-side explanation, a sustainable value proposition
increases customer willingness to pay andso differentiates the products and services to attract customers"
"A key difference between business markets and consumer markets — in consumer markets, explicit quantification of value is typically not necessary. However, in business markets, purchasing managers are frequently required to quantify the value of different offers.“value quantification capabilities substantially and positively influence performance”. Thus value proposition quantification in business markets is a key
consideration in effective value communication."
Identifying competitive CVPs represents the strategic level of their management: it entails matching customer and company perspectives for positioning around creation of customer value for competitive advantage. Identifying competitive CVPs is fruit of stra tegic decisions on what kind of value to create and what kind not to create. It is about segmentation and positioning in light of a logic centered on creating customer value that is intended to last
"The first and most important task of an entrepreneur starting a business could be to analyze market demand to ensure that the startup will provide the most suitable products or services. After a successful establishment, it is then necessary to remain strong in the competitive market. To ensure customer loyalty, each startup must consider the value it can offer customers in various forms, and how to develop and improve upon this value"
"when partners are focused on value‐in‐use as the basis for value capture, trust between partners becomes necessary support for control‐based relationships centered on contracts and other legal agreements. In short, value capture processes involve activities that enable providers and customers to determine how the additional value created should be distributed between provider and customer."
The facilitation of cross-border e-business and the integration of operation systems make companies more efficient in export trade activities andso save time and costs for consumers during online shopping activities. The information involved in online promotion can offer further support to consumer decisions by transferring information online.
"From the findings of this research, it is suggested that the quality management of packaging in online promotions is important to consumers in cross-border e-business markets. Furthermore, it is suggested that quality management of higher valued products with larger discounts isso important to online consumers in cross-border e-business markets."
"Value appropriation capability(VAC)–Technology innovation capabilities(TIC) interaction significantly improves MNC performance, and VAC–Marketing capabilities interaction positively improves MNC performance."
"Technology innovation capabilities(TIC) and marketing capabilities(MC) are the central platforms of permanent value transformation from knowledge creation, new products and service processes to cost management and customer delivery; every organisation needs TIC to create value and MC as a vehicle to deliver it to the customers."
MNC executives and managers must retained the crucial influences of value appropriation capabilities on technology innovation capabilities and marketing capabilities and their enhanced impact on the business performance of their corporations.
"In fact, “Attracting resources into a fledgling venture is perhaps the greatest challenge faced by entrepreneurs.” The more resources that a new venture can gain control of, and the quicker it can do so, the better the venture's competitive position and the more valuable the venture can become."
"At inception, a startup might be missing resources in three major areas: human capital, social capital, and financial capital. To fill those holes, “core founders” can attract cofounders, hires, and/or investors. Cofounders and hires may bring new skills and industry knowledge, have contacts with customers or potential partners, andso contribute financial capital to help get the startup off the ground. Investors can contribute far more financial capital than the typical cofounder or hire but, as described below, may vary widely in the amount of other value they might add."
"Within high-potential startups, the tension between resource attraction and the maintenance of control is real and significant, and that early founding decisions can lead to very different outcomes regarding both value creation and control. These results are robust across two different forms of value creation and across econometric approaches that both (1) fixed effects to account for unobserved time-invariant company differences and (2) control for individual- and company-level differences."
"exploiting digitalization goes hand-in-hand with business model innovation, which requires novel offerings and processes that define how value is created, delivered and captured between providers, customers, and other value chain actors"
"the emergence of digital technologies and applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence, automation, remote monitoring, predictive maintenance, smart contracts, big data, the cloud, analytics, and smart connected products offers many business development opportunities"
"the value from the investments in digitalization should be captured through the business model, such as the digital servitization business model."
"Nowadays, we are in an era where new knowledge and new technologies are emerging continuously. The technologies of cloud computing, Internet of Things, data mining, machine learning, and deep learning are applied tol walks of life."
"Big data is used as a basic strategic resource to fully implement actions to promote big data development. A report from the McKinsey Global Instituteso points out that effective capture, analysis, visualization, application of big data to insight and achieve business objectives will help enterprises stand out from the fierce competition"
"The emergence of big data will definitely subvert the traditional way of data management. It will bring revolutionary changes to data sources, data processing methods and data thinking. Changes in data management methods will inevitably lead to revolutionary changes in the way talents are trained."
"Python's programming model isso very compatible with human thinking habits, which helps us to integrate computational thinking into the teaching of Python programming."
"‘‘Big Data” is a fundamental element of digitalisation andready a valuable raw material for many industries. In combination with ‘‘Artificial Intelligence”, it is possible to structure, analyse, evaluate and large amounts of data as a basis for
 software programs that can generate new (or extended) knowledge with the technology of ‘‘Machine Learning”. From this, future forecasts can be derived as well as used in optimization measures. Often ‘‘Deep Learning” is used, which is based on the human brain and uses artificial neural networks to mimic the learning processes of humans. This makes it possible to data volumes meaningfully across the entire value chain"
"Digital technologies are forcing companies to reimagine their customer value propositions. That’s because new social and mobile applications, analytics, the internet of things, artificial intelligence, biometrics, blockchain, cloud and edge computing, and many other advanceslow them to deliver value in ways that simply were not possible in the past."
"Digital technologies are game-changing — they provide ubiquitous data, unlimited connectivity, and massive processing power. Savvy companies are convertingl this capacity into digital offerings: information-enriched solutions wrapped in seamless, personalized customer experiences."
"Successful digital offerings are created at the intersection of what technologies can deliver and what customers want and will pay for. That point of intersection, however, has proved to be elusive. To find it, companies must experiment repeatedly, cocreate with customers, and assemble cross-functional develop ment teams — and the insights gleanedong the way must be shared internally."
"Digital offerings are well suited to rapid test-and learn iteration because they are software based. Software coders can develop a minimum viable product, release it to customers or a test group, and get immediate feedback. Based on the feedback, a company can quickly enhance or discard the product."
"Because of uncertainty around how customers want to be engaged and how they view their needs, the development of digital offerings involves constantly identifying new ideas and testing their viability quickly with customers."
"Industries are consequently adjusting to adapt to the continuous usage of data, digital technologies, and digital platforms, eventually re-shaping products, work environments, and the economy. This isso fostered through the entrepreneurship active in Digital Business Models. “The culture and spirit around digital innovation” are seen as fundamental to Digital Entrepreneurship. Thereby, new firms are being set up to bring Business Models relating to Digital Innovation and Digital Transformation to the market and add value. They show a high intensity towards optimization, customer interaction, and utilization of Digital Technologies."
The large number of new opportunities driven by digitalization put pressure on SMEs to reconsider their current BMs or critically reflect on their current strategy in order to identify new business opportunities.
"extant quantitative studies are mainly related to the strategic and innovation management domain. From the handful of studies focusing on the impact of digitalization on SMEs, Gruber (2018) has recently identified four reasons to explain why digital transformation is taking place slowly in SMEs. First, small companies with their specific foci are less exposed to the need for rapid digitalization. Second, small companies often lack resources and managerial vision to fully understand the impacts of digital transformation. Third, SMEs usually adopt a gradual approach to digitalization compared to larger companies. Finally, digitalization investment within this type of companies heavily relies on firms’ financial performance and it is often the case that they have limited resources to on this area."
Incumbent assets and managerial choices jointly influence performance after new business model addition in ways neither can in isolation. An incumbent firm’s managerial choices for its assets serve dual roles: (1) choice on the timing of new business model addition helps unlock the potential of complementary assets; and (2) choice on the organizational configuration of the new business model helps vaccinate against the detriment of conflicting assets.
"To increase the success of the designed BM on the market, the company must analyze variousternatives, have a good understanding of customer requirements, a precise understanding of the value chain so as to deliver what customers need as cost-effectively as possible and on time and shouldso have a neutral perspective on outsourcing. Hence, the ability to adapt the BM can be seen as a dynamic capability itself."
"Predominantly changes in the form of new offers (products, services, or solution packages in the form of cloud computing or predictive maintenance) are driving changes in the BM. As the number of offers, such as services and solution packages, increases, customer relationships are intensified. Relationships morph into long-term collaborations to satisfy customer needs."
"It is the learning-driven approach of sensing, seizing and reconfiguring in particular, which provides the business with opportunity to adapt and meet changing requirements inignment with the business strategy : first, technology and BM sensing implies both the ability to translate technological capabilities to new BM ideas and recognizeternative BMs that are in place among competitors and across industry boundaries. "
The potential of digitalization and novel applications as well as an integrated view of the product life cycle are changing the way value is generated and new and innovative BMs are developed.
"Companies can be successful over time if they can adapt to their environment. The dynamic capability is a suitable perspective that explains this phenomenon and is even more important in volatile environments. “During recent years, dynamic capability research has developed a framework outlining how firms adapt their physical, human, and organizational resource bases when facing situations of technological or market change”.

"Just as financial institutions try to create portfolios of investments that will hedge one another’s risks, companies can select an assortment of products or markets to reduce the overall riskiness of the business model. "
"This hasso been confirmed frequently: Big Data (new data sources), automation (changed machine functions), interconnectionsong the value chain (breakup up of non-transparency) and digital customer interfaces create the foundations for new BMs and potentially restructure the individual sectors."
"A key is to secure theignment between incumbent assets and managerial choices: an incumbent needs to discriminatinglyign its assets with the right managerial choices to capitalize on complementary assets and to inoculate conflicting assets, thereby garnering better BMI performance."
"An innovative business model can either create a new market orlow a company to create and exploit new opportunities in existing markets. Dell, for example, implemented a customer-driven, build-to-order business model that replaced the traditional build-to-stock model of selling computers through retail stores."

"Key concept generators are environmental (urban context), social (cultural and common), temporal (growth), and aesthetic (tradition) programming values and indicators (Ristić Trajković, Milovanović, & Nikezić, 2021: 21).  The role of the environment in understanding social processes has pointed out the necessity of implementing environment–behavior knowledge in architectural practice. The recognition that architecture and urbanism usually do not take into account and consider people’s behavior and individual perception, as well as desires, social norms, dynamics, cultural values, and expectations in their planning perspectives, initiated the methodological framework that enables the implementation of this knowledge in architectural design (Ristić Trajković., 2021: 3)."

" Often an emotional benefit such as reducing anxiety is as important as a functional one such as saving time (Ericmquist, John Senior, & Nicolas Bloch, 2016: 05). 
Products and services deliver fundamental elements of value that address four kinds of needs: functional, emotional, life-changing, and social impact. In general, the more elements provided, the greater customers’ loyalty and the higher the company’s sustained revenue growth (Ericmquist., 2016: 1)."
"The immediate concerns of value appropriation, point out that innovation can generate value by asset appreciation (Jacobides, Knudsen, & Augier, 2006: 03). The notions of complementarity and mobility are best treated as independent aspects of co-specialization because they capture distinct economic effects. Complementarity influences the size of the value to be bargained over (some combinations yield higher value, others lower value, depending on their “fit”). In contrast, mobility influences the bargaining power of the asset holders, and thus the division of the value (some assets cannot be replaced other assets can be replaced by numerous equivalents at negligible cost) (Jacobides., 2006: 7)."
"Innovationso ensures the continuity and sustainability of a company. An innovation could be an implementation of a new product or process (good or service) or its significantly improved version, a new marketing method, or a new organizational method in business practices, workplace organization, or external relations (OCDE, 1997) (Santos., 2019: 01).
Saraiva and D’Orey (1999) argued that innovation is an added value to the competitive level of companies, making a difference in the survival of organizations in environments of increasing change and in the struggle for the same objectives (Santos., 2019: 2)."
"The conceptual model goal is to reconsider new ways of living and leisure adapted to contemporary man and reconsider the position of work and education in contemporary urban housing, especially considering continuous change and unexpected circumstances such as the pandemic.

"Business models capture how firms ‘do business’. Specifically, they explain how businesses create and secure value (Amit and Zott, 2001; Magretta, 2002, p.1). For new technology-based firms (NTBFs) that are new firms in high-tech industries, business model development is crucial for firms’ abilities to create and capture value (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002; Teece, 2010), the commercialisation of their offerings (Dmitriev., 2014, p.2.), and, thus, for their performance (Alcalde and Guerrero, 2016; Pucci., 2017; Anwar, 2018, p.2.). This model development rarely happens without external assistance, as entrepreneurs (the founders) need to interact with stakeholders to reduce the resource scarcity that is unavoidable in the start-up stages."
"Due to a considerable need in the start-up phase to access resources for the to develop as well as no existing organisational rules or
procedurals to follow for making decisions, stakeholder influence may be particularly salient as stakeholders can influence founders’ mental schemas through their
interactions. Thus, stakeholders play a considerable role in how the firm’s initial business model is developed. Accordingly, the roles of stakeholders in business model development are not solely linked to NTBF resource needs, butso provide and influence mental schemas through interactions with the founders. ( Rydehell, 2020, p.3.)"
"Avoid pricing products as “loss leaders,” as it sets expectations and precedents that you can sometimes not change. If you want to introduce a product at a reduced cost, price it as a promotional offer with a limited time frame and/or quantity that is being extended based on a larger, more profitable commitment. Provide after-promotion pricing to avoid misunderstandings.(Harney. 2020. p.3.)"
"the value creation of dispersed innovation is underestimated. While most research explore the impact of dispersed innovation on innovativeness by estimating the value stemming mainly from the geographical dispersion of R&D activities, few studies take into account the value resulting from the functional interdependence among R&D and other innovation activities in host locations (Mudambi, Narula, & Santangelo, 2018, p.1.). Given that innovation activities include R&D, engineering, design, and other creative work (OECD, 2018, p.1.), functional interdependence is the interconnectedness of various activities in the same location (Teece, 2014, p.1.). Since functional interdependence can produce complementarity and scope economies for firms to improve performance (Alc´acer & Delgado, 2016,p.1.), we need to consider the value of both geographical dispersion and functional interdependence generated by various innovation activities in host locations."
"The business environment is rapidly changing for NTBFs; hence, the business model must be adapted to changes in the environment to ensure that competitive advantage is sustained (Chesbrough, 2010; Cosenz and Noto, 2018). Moreover, for the new to commercialise its technology (product or service), several components need to function together (Dmitriev., 2014). For example, founders need to identify customer segments and their needs, determine the benefits of using the firm’s technology, and identify and confirm revenue streams to capture value (Magretta, 2002; Teece, 2010). Several components of a business model have been discussed and elaborated on by extant research. However, the ones most discussed are linked to how firms create, deliver, and capture value (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002; Osterwalder., 2005; Teece, 2010). These models include the value proposition, customer segment and relationships, distribution channels, partner networks, key resources and assets, and revenue and cost structures. The value proposition is centred as the ‘heart’ of the business model with customer-related activities and revenues as front-office activities, and resources, partners, and costs as back-office activities.

"The literature on cognitive frames in sustainability suggests that the effectiveness of managerial approaches to business sustainability is determined by managers’ acknowledgement of organisational tensions involving environmental,

"Selecting the size based on virtual garments is more accurate than size selection based on primary measurements and size charts, scoring 57% and 42%, respectively.Research should be used to improve the virtual fitting room, with benefits such as fewer returns and more satisfied customers.(Hernandez, 2019: p 249)"
"In apparel online retailing, creating factors that consumer relates as value and consumer satisfaction has strict relation with physical experience (Song and Ashdown, 2010). Cordier. (2001) showed that the lack of physical experience is a basic reason why consumers hesitate to buy online. Since the of the purchased product depends on the choice of the right size, fitting is even more important thanl other physical properties. “Choosing right size” is cited as one of the biggest barriers against apparel online retailing (Merriam, 2009; Pastore, 2000)."
"That the consumer wants to purchase high-quality apparel, which satisfies their fitting preferences, in an easy and cost-effective manner. This is not a
problem when it comes to small brick-and-mortar shops where the consumer can touch the fabric, look at the color, try on the apparel, etc. The challenge arises in online apparel stores, where the consumer is able to evaluate the apparel qualities only virtually. Online apparel stores provide consumers with various benefits, such as saving time and money, 24-hour availability, better service in general, a fast (and easy) process of shopping and a greater choice of products compared with brick-and-mortar shops (Monsuwe, Dellaert, & Ruyter, 2004; Loker, Ashdown, Cowie,& Schoenfelder, 2004; Orzan, Iconaru, Popescu, Orzan, & Macovei, 2013)"
"Online consumers are searching and evaluating information regarding the effectiveness of apparel through the virtual product experience (Yu, Lee, & Damhorst, 2012). Therefore, online shops on their websites try to provide the consumer with the most realistic experience, similar to shopping in a brick-and-mortar store. This is achieved through the integration of advanced image interactive technology (Yu., 2012), which enables the creation and manipulation of the products or the environment to simulate the actual experience with the product and the environment (Yang & Young, 2009), for example: expansion or zoom, 3D rotation and personal 3D models in a virtual fitting room for trying on apparel. Per authors Loker, Ashdown, and Carnrite (2008); Kim and LaBat (2013); Yang and Young (2009); Boonbrahma, Kaewrata, and Boonbrahma (2015) virtual fitting technology in the online store solves problems such as the fit of ready-to-wear apparel, choosing the appropriate size and style, and overconsumptionof time on the purchase."
"Diffusion of innovation theory explains the process by
which an innovation is introduced, communicated,

"Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to focus on the development of a system which willlow an easy online purchase of custom-made apparel of high quality at a lower cost. In order to move in this direction, it is necessary to further develop the technology and integrate it into the system. In addition, a cost efficiency analysis of such a system should be conducted from both the consumers’ and the manufacturers’ perspectives. After the implementation of such a system, the consumers’ satisfaction with custom-made apparel bought online should be investigated based on several factors (e.g. personal characteristics,fashion involvement, body satisfaction, purchase behavior, general attitude towards novelties with an emphasis on new technologies).(ŽURAJ. 2017, p.10)."
"Furthermore, because of apparel size differences between companies, comparing body and apparel size will help to prevent faults against other systems, which previously purchased apparel size. However, the success of this system is directly related with true body and apparel sizes and

"Data are the first step in advancing our understanding of real estate and enabling effective of ML. Without sources of clean, structured data, it is impossible to train models and get insights. ML is an effective tool used in structuring data and aggregating various information sources, a task that has proven to be a roadblock for many real estate companies in the past. These data include traffic information, sales reports, revenue statistics, location information, and customer demographics (LocateAI, Inc. 2018). The users of these data may be the technology firms themselves, who leverage the information to improve their platforms for users. Others may sell the data as a service to their clients, who might be investors, lenders, and other professionals in the industry.(Viriato, 2019)"
"Despite the benefits of machine learning for prediction, its contribution to the processes
of inference is virtually nil. According to Mullainathan and Spiess (2017), machine learning
addresses the needs of prediction, but most applications in economics revolve around the
estimation and interpretation of the parameters of the model. Athey (2018) is consistent
with this, pointing out that causal inference is typical in the economics literature, but that
machine learning does not address the needs of estimation. Overcoming this limitation is
crucial in the context of real estate, since the interpretation of the obtained function, the
identification of the most important variables, and the estimation of the marginal effects,
among other things, are fundamental topics for the generation of knowledge and economic
decision making.(Pérez-Rave, Correa-Morales and González-Echavarría, 2019)

"When ML and AI are used improperly, the results can be undesirable. Unfortunately, several of the firms interviewed noted that it can be hard in today’s competitive world of computing to find good data scientists.15 The chief executive officer (CEO) of Leverton, Abhinav Somani, stated that companies are probably experiencing challenges applying ML and AI because it takes specialists, and it is best to hire PhDs and high-caliber professionals with hands-on experience in developing scalable solutions. Heso noted that real estate technology and other start-ups may have trouble hiring from these specialized talent pools when competing with major companies. Successful real estate technology firms must find good talent to help avoid common pitfalls of ML.(Viriato, 2019)"
